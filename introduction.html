    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Thanks for taking The Inn Bible Challenge. We know that Scripture is often intimidating, but it is where we turn in our faith to discover more and more and know better the heart of God. In Psalm 119, the Psalmist prays to God, “your word I have hidden in my heart,” and when we dive deeper into Scripture, our prayer can be the same.</p>
    <p>Our vision with this challenge is that you would be able to see that the Bible is one big story. The story of God and the nation of Israel and the person of Jesus and the start of the church are all connected as a larger narrative. Ultimately, our hope is that this grand story would connect to your own story of walking in faith with Jesus, and see him in your life every single day.</p>
    <h3>How To</h3>
    <p>Each day’s reading should take about 10 minutes or so, and we have pointed out some elements of God’s big story to look out for each day, as well as some questions to reflect on. In between readings, there is a bit of extra info to connect the pieces of the narrative together. Some days, we’ve added a bonus New Testament reading to better bridge the Old with the New and with Jesus.</p>
    <h3>What to Look For</h3>
    <p><strong>Continuity of God</strong> The God of Israel is the same God made known in Jesus Christ in the New Testament and the same God that we live in relationship with down to today. God’s power, love, justice, redemption, judgment, compassion and faithfulness have been and will be the same yesterday, today, and forever. God is always constant, and always consistent.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuity of God's Word</strong> God’s creation is the same gift to every generation and every individual. Also, the world God created in wholeness has been broken, and this brokenness—followed by God’s redemption and reconciliation—continues throughout the Old Testament, New Testament and up to today.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuity of God's People</strong> The community of God’s people didn’t begin with Jesus and the early church, but it is a branch off of a Jewish tradition bridged from the Old Testament.</p>
    <p><strong>Continuity of God's Work</strong> God’s work can be seen in the writings and experiences of ancient Israel and can easily be recognized by us in our world today as well.</p>
    <h3>Questions To Consider Everyday</h3>
    <p>In what ways does this story connect with the overall narrative of scripture as I know it?</p>
    <p>What side of the character of God do I see displayed in this story?</p>
    <p>How is the character of God I see lived out in Jesus' life/Where is Jesus in the story?</p>
    <p>In what ways does this story connect with my story?</p>
