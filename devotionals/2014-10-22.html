    <h1>Week 2: The Law and The Land</h1>
    <h3>Freedom From Slavery</h3>
    <p>This Exodus from Egypt is <strong>one of two cataclysmic, defining events</strong> in the life of Israel throughout the Old Testament. It is through this Exodus that Israel sees itself and continues to define itself even today. This is not a history lesson read about the past but is told as a story that is continuing to happen right now because we always have new pharaohs, we always have new circumstances of slavery.</p>
    <p>The themes of God come through loudly in the Exodus. First, it is a story of <strong>deliverance</strong> from slavery. It demonstrates in a world divided into haves and have-nots, God is on the side of the have-nots. Israel has a God of freedom from that which binds. Second, it is a story of <strong>provision</strong>, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for 40 years and God provides sustenance with no visible source.</p>
