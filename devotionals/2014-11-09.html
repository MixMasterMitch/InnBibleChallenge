    <h3>Evil kings & good kings</h3>
    <p>As a result of the rebellion against Solomon and his heirs, Israel divides into two nations, King Jeroboam ruling over the kingdom of Israel (ten tribes in the north) with Shechem as the capital city and Samaria as a prominent city, and King Rehoboam ruling over the kingdom of Judah (two tribes in the south) with Jerusalem as the capital and most prominent city. Throughout the Old Testament, though, the people of Judah are still often referred to as “Israelites.”</p>
    <p>Each nation had several kings—some evil, some described as being “after God’s heart.” This also marks the rise of the prophets amongst God’s people through whom God’s words and intentions were stated to the kings of Israel and Judah and to God’s people.</p>
    <p>Today's reading assignment is <strong>2 Kings 8:16-24 and 13:1-14:29</strong>. As you read, pay attention to the role of God in relation to the evil kings and the good kings and how often the kings rest in security other than God.</p>
