    <h1>Week 3: Becoming a Nation</h1>
    <p>When Israel reaches the promised land and moves into it, Israel divides up the land amongst the 12 tribes, which were the descendants of the 12 sons of Jacob (described in Joshua). The tribes begin the difficult process of being God’s people (a community set apart with a specific covenant) amongst other peoples and cultures. Outside cultures and religions influence the people of Israel heavily, they forget their God and choose other Gods. Israel falls into a cycle of sin, oppression by outside invaders, repentance for denying God, and deliverance by a “Judge,” or a leader, from within Israel’s community. </p>
    <p>Additionally, Samuel—Israel’s prophet and priest and the people’s main connection to God—would travel from tribe to tribe and act as leader and judge when necessary. Slowly, the loose tribal federation with separate tribal identities becomes a nation under one king, and Samuel aids the transition.</p>
