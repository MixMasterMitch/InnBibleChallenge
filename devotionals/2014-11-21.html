    <h3>Life of Exile: Returning and Rebuilding</h3>
    <p>Today's reading assignment is <strong>Ezra 1:1-8, 8:15-36, 9:1-4 and Nehemiah 2, 13</strong>. As you read, pay attention to the focus on building a nation with God at the center and the expectations placed on obedience and life practice to ensure the goal.</p>
    <p>King Cyrus of the Persian Empire eventually allows the exiles to return to Judah and gives them permission and support to rebuild a temple to God, the walls of Jerusalem, as well as the community.</p>
