    <h1>Additional Info</h1>
    <p>In the middle of the Old Testament and the story of Israel are the wisdom books, which are Scripture that is more a response to what’s happening in the story and metaphor to understand the story than they are the story itself. Wisdom books include Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes among others, and they demonstrate the deep beauty and mystery of God and God’s involvement with God’s people. They are honest and vulnerable, full of reactions and emotions with regard to the story of Israel as God’s people in the world.</p>
    <p>There are three basic types of Psalms—orientation/praise, disorientation/lament, and reorientation/thanksgiving. Many of the Psalms are attributed to King David.</p>
