    <h1>Additional Info</h1>
    <p>When Israel became a community, they also created the Torah (the book of law). They needed guidelines on how to live as God’s people in the world, and these laws taught them how. The laws were divided into two main categories: holiness -- seeking purity to honor a holy God, and civic justice -- seeking to care for those in need, in the same way God cared for them.</p>
    <p>Even today, Jewish prayer practice includes following how Deuteronomy 6:4-8 instructs the Israelites to worship. The Torah (God’s law) is enclosed in boxes (called tefillin) that worshipers wrap on their arms and on their heads while saying prayers to God.</p>

    <p>Also, the Torah is enclosed in small scrolls (called mezuzah).</p>

    <h1>New Testament Bonus</h1>
    <p>Read <strong>Matthew 5:21-22, 5:27-28, and 5:38-42</strong>. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus intensifies the laws of the Old Testament. Why would Jesus make it seemingly more difficult to follow the law?</p>
