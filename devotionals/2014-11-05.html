    <h1>Week 4: The Kingdom Rises and Falls</h1>
    <p>Over time, Israel becomes a kingdom and has the most prosperous time in its history under King David—the king after God’s own heart—and his son, King Solomon. The capital, Jerusalem, was a thriving city, God was the center of life for Israel, and Solomon completed a temple where God could dwell with his chosen people Israel. For a short time, Israel was the community it saw itself as being: “The people called by God for the sake of the world.”</p>
