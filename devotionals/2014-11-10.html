    <h1>Week 4, Day 6</h1>
    <h2>November 10, 2014</h2>
    <h3>Rise of the prophets to the Northern Kingdom (Israel)</h3>
    <p>Israel & Judah spent little time paying attention to God, and many prophets spoke to Israel & Judah on God’s behalf to remind them of the covenant of promise, deliverance and provision, the covenant that they had with their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt. Instead of acknowledging God and living into their calling as God’s people, Israel continued to invest in the things and cultures of the world around them, ignoring God, the prophets, and the potential threats of outside invaders.</p>
    <p>There are several prophetic books in the Old Testament, and they are typically focused on the themes of Judgment (by God on Israel & Judah), Loss (of everything Israel & Judah knew and thought), and finally Hope (redemption out of destruction).</p>
    <p>Today's reading assignment is <strong>Hosea 1; 2; 11:1-11 Amos 4; 5</strong>. As you read, pay attention to the harsh descriptions that God uses in reference to Israel, and the hurt and feelings of betrayal apparent in God’s words.</p>
