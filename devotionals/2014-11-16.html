    <h3>Response to destruction—God’s promise for a future</h3>
    <p>The second cataclysmic, defining event for the Israelites was the exile to Babylon. Much of the Old Testament is written to come to terms with this date when Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, the place where God was supposed to dwell with them. After the exile happens, many prophets take the old stories of promise, deliverance, provision and covenant that they could remember (Genesis and Exodus) and ask— given that, how are we to understand this destruction? Where is God? How could our God abandon us? It was a defining loss, the loss of everything after too long of living in an illusion.</p>
    <p>Today's reading assignment is <strong>Isaiah 52-55</strong>. As you read, pay attention to: In the midst of chaos, destruction and the end of God’s people as a nation, there are proclamations of what is yet to come.</p>
