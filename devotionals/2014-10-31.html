    <h1>Additional Info</h1>
    <p>The authority of King Saul is challenged and many Israelites begin to support David instead of Saul after David kills the giant Philistine, Goliath. Israel begins to become a kingdom and has the most prosperous time in its history under King David—the king after God’s own heart—and his son, King Solomon, which lasted about 100 years. The capital, Jerusalem, was a thriving city, God was the center of life for Israel, and Solomon completed a temple where God could dwell with his chosen people, the Israelites. For a short time, Israel was the community it saw itself as being: “The people called by God for the sake of the world.”</p>
