Let the king appoint officials in every province of his kingdom to bring every beautiful young virgin to the palace complex of Susa and to the harem run by Hegai, the king’s eunuch who oversees the women; he will put them through their beauty treatments. Then let the girl who best pleases the king be made queen in place of Vashti.”</span></p><p><span class="text Esth-2-1-Esth-2-4">The king liked this advice and took it.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-5688" class="text Esth-2-5-Esth-2-7"><sup class="versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>Now there was a Jew who lived in the palace complex in Susa. His name was Mordecai the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish—a Benjaminite. His ancestors had been taken from Jerusalem with the exiles and carried off with King Jehoiachin of Judah by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon into exile. Mordecai had reared his cousin Hadassah, otherwise known as Esther, since she had no father or mother. The girl had a good figure and a beautiful face. After her parents died, Mordecai had adopted her.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5689" class="text Esth-2-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>When the king’s order had been publicly posted, many young girls were brought to the palace complex of Susa and given over to Hegai who was overseer of the women. Esther was among them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5690" class="text Esth-2-9-Esth-2-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>Hegai liked Esther and took a special interest in her. Right off he started her beauty treatments, ordered special food, assigned her seven personal maids from the palace, and put her and her maids in the best rooms in the harem. Esther didn’t say anything about her family and racial background because Mordecai had told her not to.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5691" class="text Esth-2-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Every day Mordecai strolled beside the court of the harem to find out how Esther was and get news of what she was doing.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5692" class="text Esth-2-12-Esth-2-14"><sup class="versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>Each girl’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes after she had completed the twelve months of prescribed beauty treatments—six months’ treatment with oil of myrrh followed by six months with perfumes and various cosmetics. When it was time for the girl to go to the king, she was given whatever she wanted to take with her when she left the harem for the king’s quarters. She would go there in the evening; in the morning she would return to a second harem overseen by Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the concubines. She never again went back to the king unless the king took a special liking to her and asked for her by name.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5693" class="text Esth-2-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>When it was Esther’s turn to go to the king (Esther the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had adopted her as his daughter), she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the harem, had recommended. Esther, just as she was, won the admiration of everyone who saw her.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5694" class="text Esth-2-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of the king’s reign.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5695" class="text Esth-2-17-Esth-2-18"><sup class="versenum">17-18&nbsp;</sup>The king fell in love with Esther far more than with any of his other women or any of the other virgins—he was totally smitten by her. He placed a royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. Then the king gave a great banquet for all his nobles and officials—“Esther’s Banquet.” He proclaimed a holiday for all the provinces and handed out gifts with royal generosity.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-5696" class="text Esth-2-19-Esth-2-20"><sup class="versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>On one of the occasions when the virgins were being gathered together, Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate. All this time, Esther had kept her family background and race a secret as Mordecai had ordered; Esther still did what Mordecai told her, just as when she was being raised by him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5697" class="text Esth-2-21-Esth-2-23"><sup class="versenum">21-23&nbsp;</sup>On this day, with Mordecai sitting at the King’s Gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had it in for the king and were making plans to kill King Xerxes. But Mordecai learned of the plot and told Queen Esther, who then told King Xerxes, giving credit to Mordecai. When the thing was investigated and confirmed as true, the two men were hanged on a gallows. This was all written down in a logbook kept for the king’s use.</span></p> <p class="top-1 chapter-1"><span id="en-MSG-5698" class="text Esth-3-1-Esth-3-2"><span class="chapternum">3&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>Some time later, King Xerxes promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, making him the highest-ranking official in the government. All the king’s servants at the King’s Gate used to honor him by bowing down and kneeling before Haman—that’s what the king had commanded.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5699" class="text Esth-3-2-Esth-3-4"><sup class="versenum">2-4&nbsp;</sup>Except Mordecai. Mordecai wouldn’t do it, wouldn’t bow down and kneel. The king’s servants at the King’s Gate asked Mordecai about it: “Why do you cross the king’s command?” Day after day they spoke to him about this but he wouldn’t listen, so they went to Haman to see whether something shouldn’t be done about it. Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5700" class="text Esth-3-5-Esth-3-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>When Haman saw for himself that Mordecai didn’t bow down and kneel before him, he was outraged. Meanwhile, having learned that Mordecai was a Jew, Haman hated to waste his fury on just one Jew; he looked for a way to eliminate not just Mordecai but all Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5701" class="text Esth-3-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>In the first month, the month of Nisan, of the twelfth year of Xerxes, the <i>pur</i>—that is, the lot—was cast under Haman’s charge to determine the propitious day and month. The lot turned up the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5702" class="text Esth-3-8-Esth-3-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>Haman then spoke with King Xerxes: “There is an odd set of people scattered through the provinces of your kingdom who don’t fit in. Their customs and ways are different from those of everybody else. Worse, they disregard the king’s laws. They’re an affront; the king shouldn’t put up with them. If it please the king, let orders be given that they be destroyed. I’ll pay for it myself. I’ll deposit 375 tons of silver in the royal bank to finance the operation.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5703" class="text Esth-3-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>The king slipped his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, archenemy of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5704" class="text Esth-3-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>“Go ahead,” the king said to Haman. “It’s your money—do whatever you want with those people.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5705" class="text Esth-3-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>The king’s secretaries were brought in on the thirteenth day of the first month. The orders were written out word for word as Haman had addressed them to the king’s satraps, the governors of every province, and the officials of every people. They were written in the script of each province and the language of each people in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the royal signet ring.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5706" class="text Esth-3-13-Esth-3-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>Bulletins were sent out by couriers to all the king’s provinces with orders to massacre, kill, and eliminate all the Jews—youngsters and old men, women and babies—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar, and to plunder their goods. Copies of the bulletin were to be posted in each province, publicly available to all peoples, to get them ready for that day.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5707" class="text Esth-3-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>At the king’s command, the couriers took off; the order was also posted in the palace complex of Susa. The king and Haman sat back and had a drink while the city of Susa reeled from the news.</span></p> <p class="chapter-1"><span id="en-MSG-5708" class="text Esth-4-1-Esth-4-3"><span class="chapternum">4&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup>When Mordecai learned what had been done, he ripped his clothes to shreds and put on sackcloth and ashes. Then he went out in the streets of the city crying out in loud and bitter cries. He came only as far as the King’s Gate, for no one dressed in sackcloth was allowed to enter the King’s Gate. As the king’s order was posted in every province, there was loud lament among the Jews—fasting, weeping, wailing. And most of them stretched out on sackcloth and ashes.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5709" class="text Esth-4-4-Esth-4-8"><sup class="versenum">4-8&nbsp;</sup>Esther’s maids and eunuchs came and told her. The queen was stunned. She sent fresh clothes to Mordecai so he could take off his sackcloth but he wouldn’t accept them. Esther called for Hathach, one of the royal eunuchs whom the king had assigned to wait on her, and told him to go to Mordecai and get the full story of what was happening. So Hathach went to Mordecai in the town square in front of the King’s Gate. Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him. He also told him the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to deposit in the royal bank to finance the massacre of the Jews. Mordecai also gave him a copy of the bulletin that had been posted in Susa ordering the massacre so he could show it to Esther when he reported back with instructions to go to the king and intercede and plead with him for her people.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5710" class="text Esth-4-9-Esth-4-11"><sup class="versenum">9-11&nbsp;</sup>Hathach came back and told Esther everything Mordecai had said. Esther talked it over with Hathach and then sent him back to Mordecai with this message: “Everyone who works for the king here, and even the people out in the provinces, knows that there is a single fate for every man or woman who approaches the king without being invited: death. The one exception is if the king extends his gold scepter; then he or she may live. And it’s been thirty days now since I’ve been invited to come to the king.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5711" class="text Esth-4-12-Esth-4-14"><sup class="versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>When Hathach told Mordecai what Esther had said, Mordecai sent her this message: “Don’t think that just because you live in the king’s house you’re the one Jew who will get out of this alive. If you persist in staying silent at a time like this, help and deliverance will arrive for the Jews from someplace else; but you and your family will be wiped out. Who knows? Maybe you were made queen for just such a time as this.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5712" class="text Esth-4-15-Esth-4-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>Esther sent back her answer to Mordecai: “Go and get all the Jews living in Susa together. Fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days, either day or night. I and my maids will fast with you. If you will do this, I’ll go to the king, even though it’s forbidden. If I die, I die.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5713" class="text Esth-4-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Mordecai left and carried out Esther’s instructions.</span></p>
