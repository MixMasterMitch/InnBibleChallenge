Don’t add a word to what I command you, and don’t remove a word from it. Keep the commands of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, that I am commanding you.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2152" class="text Deut-4-3-Deut-4-4"><sup class="versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>You saw with your own eyes what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> did at Baal Peor, how <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> destroyed from among you every man who joined in the Baal Peor orgies. But you, the ones who held tight to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, are alive and well, every one of you, today.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2153" class="text Deut-4-5-Deut-4-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>Pay attention: I’m teaching you the rules and regulations that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> commanded me, so that you may live by them in the land you are entering to take up ownership. Keep them. Practice them. You’ll become wise and understanding. When people hear and see what’s going on, they’ll say, “What a great nation! So wise, so understanding! We’ve never seen anything like it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2154" class="text Deut-4-7-Deut-4-8"><sup class="versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>Yes. What other great nation has gods that are intimate with them the way <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, our God, is with us, always ready to listen to us? And what other great nation has rules and regulations as good and fair as this Revelation that I’m setting before you today?</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2155" class="text Deut-4-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Just make sure you stay alert. Keep close watch over yourselves. Don’t forget anything of what you’ve seen. Don’t let your heart wander off. Stay vigilant as long as you live. Teach what you’ve seen and heard to your children and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2156" class="text Deut-4-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>That day when you stood before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, at Horeb, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to me, “Assemble the people in my presence to listen to my words so that they will learn to fear me in holy fear for as long as they live on the land, and then they will teach these same words to their children.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2157" class="text Deut-4-11-Deut-4-13"><sup class="versenum">11-13&nbsp;</sup>You gathered. You stood in the shadow of the mountain. The mountain was ablaze with fire, blazing high into the very heart of Heaven. You stood in deep darkness and thick clouds. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but you saw nothing—no form, only a voice. He announced his covenant, the Ten Words, by which he commanded you to live. Then he wrote them down on two slabs of stone.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2158" class="text Deut-4-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>And <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> commanded me at that time to teach you the rules and regulations that you are to live by in the land which you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.</span></p>
