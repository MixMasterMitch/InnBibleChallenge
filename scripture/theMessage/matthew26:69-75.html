One servant girl came up to him and said, “You were with Jesus the Galilean.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10326" class="text Matt-26-70"><sup class="versenum">70&nbsp;</sup>In front of everybody there, he denied it. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10327" class="text Matt-26-71"><sup class="versenum">71&nbsp;</sup>As he moved over toward the gate, someone else said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10328" class="text Matt-26-72"><sup class="versenum">72&nbsp;</sup>Again he denied it, salting his denial with an oath: “I swear, I never laid eyes on the man.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10329" class="text Matt-26-73"><sup class="versenum">73&nbsp;</sup>Shortly after that, some bystanders approached Peter. “You’ve got to be one of them. Your accent gives you away.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10330" class="text Matt-26-74-Matt-26-75"><sup class="versenum">74-75&nbsp;</sup>Then he got really nervous and swore. “I don’t know the man!”</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-26-74-Matt-26-75">Just then a rooster crowed. Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” He went out and cried and cried and cried.</span></p>
