The men of Kiriath Jearim came and got the Chest of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and delivered it to the house of Abinadab on the hill. They ordained his son, Eleazar, to take responsibility for the Chest of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3262" class="text 1Sam-7-2"><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>From the time that the Chest came to rest in Kiriath Jearim, a long time passed—twenty years it was—and throughout Israel there was a widespread, fearful movement toward <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3263" class="text 1Sam-7-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then Samuel addressed the house of Israel: “If you are truly serious about coming back to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, clean house. Get rid of the foreign gods and fertility goddesses, ground yourselves firmly in <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, worship him and him alone, and he’ll save you from Philistine oppression.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3264" class="text 1Sam-7-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>They did it. They got rid of the gods and goddesses, the images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and gave their exclusive attention and service to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3265" class="text 1Sam-7-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Next Samuel said, “Get everybody together at Mizpah and I’ll pray for you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3266" class="text 1Sam-7-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>So everyone assembled at Mizpah. They drew water from the wells and poured it out before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> in a ritual of cleansing. They fasted all day and prayed, “We have sinned against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-7-6">So Samuel prepared the Israelites for holy war there at Mizpah.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-3267" class="text 1Sam-7-7">The Place Where God Helped Us</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Sam-7-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>When the Philistines heard that Israel was meeting at Mizpah, the Philistine leaders went on the offensive. Israel got the report and became frightened—Philistines on the move again!</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3268" class="text 1Sam-7-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray with all your might! And don’t let up! Pray to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, our God, that he’ll save us from the boot of the Philistines.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3269" class="text 1Sam-7-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Samuel took a young lamb not yet weaned and offered it whole as a Whole-Burnt-Offering to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. He prayed fervently to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, interceding for Israel. And <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> answered.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3270" class="text 1Sam-7-10-1Sam-7-12"><sup class="versenum">10-12&nbsp;</sup>While Samuel was offering the sacrifice, the Philistines came within range to fight Israel. Just then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> thundered, a huge thunderclap exploding among the Philistines. They panicked—mass confusion!—and ran helter-skelter from Israel. Israel poured out of Mizpah and gave chase, killing Philistines right and left, to a point just beyond Beth Car. Samuel took a single rock and set it upright between Mizpah and Shen. He named it “Ebenezer” (Rock of Help), saying, “This marks the place where <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> helped us.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3271" class="text 1Sam-7-13-1Sam-7-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>The Philistines learned their lesson and stayed home—no more border crossings. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was hard on the Philistines all through Samuel’s lifetime. All the cities from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored. Israel also freed the surrounding countryside from Philistine control. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3272" class="text 1Sam-7-15-1Sam-7-17"><sup class="versenum">15-17&nbsp;</sup>Samuel gave solid leadership to Israel his entire life. Every year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah. He gave leadership to Israel in each of these places. But always he would return to Ramah, where he lived, and preside from there. That is where he built an altar to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-3273" class="text 1Sam-8-1-1Sam-8-3">Rejecting God as the King</span></h3><p class="first-line-none chapter-1"><span class="text 1Sam-8-1-1Sam-8-3"><span class="chapternum">8&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup>When Samuel got to be an old man, he set his sons up as judges in Israel. His firstborn son was named Joel, the name of his second, Abijah. They were assigned duty in Beersheba. But his sons didn’t take after him; they were out for what they could get for themselves, taking bribes, corrupting justice.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3274" class="text 1Sam-8-4-1Sam-8-5"><sup class="versenum">4-5&nbsp;</sup>Fed up, all the elders of Israel got together and confronted Samuel at Ramah. They presented their case: “Look, you’re an old man, and your sons aren’t following in your footsteps. Here’s what we want you to do: Appoint a king to rule us, just like everybody else.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3275" class="text 1Sam-8-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When Samuel heard their demand—“Give us a king to rule us!”—he was crushed. How awful! Samuel prayed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3276" class="text 1Sam-8-7-1Sam-8-9"><sup class="versenum">7-9&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> answered Samuel, “Go ahead and do what they’re asking. They are not rejecting you. They’ve rejected me as their King. From the day I brought them out of Egypt until this very day they’ve been behaving like this, leaving me for other gods. And now they’re doing it to you. So let them have their own way. But warn them of what they’re in for. Tell them the way kings operate, just what they’re likely to get from a king.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3277" class="text 1Sam-8-10-1Sam-8-18"><sup class="versenum">10-18&nbsp;</sup>So Samuel told them, delivered <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s warning to the people who were asking him to give them a king. He said, “This is the way the kind of king you’re talking about operates. He’ll take your sons and make soldiers of them—chariotry, cavalry, infantry, regimented in battalions and squadrons. He’ll put some to forced labor on his farms, plowing and harvesting, and others to making either weapons of war or chariots in which he can ride in luxury. He’ll put your daughters to work as beauticians and waitresses and cooks. He’ll conscript your best fields, vineyards, and orchards and hand them over to his special friends. He’ll tax your harvests and vintage to support his extensive bureaucracy. Your prize workers and best animals he’ll take for his own use. He’ll lay a tax on your flocks and you’ll end up no better than slaves. The day will come when you will cry in desperation because of this king you so much want for yourselves. But don’t expect <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> to answer.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3278" class="text 1Sam-8-19-1Sam-8-20"><sup class="versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>But the people wouldn’t listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We will have a king to rule us! Then we’ll be just like all the other nations. Our king will rule us and lead us and fight our battles.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3279" class="text 1Sam-8-21-1Sam-8-22"><sup class="versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>Samuel took in what they said and rehearsed it with <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told Samuel, “Do what they say. Make them a king.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-8-21-1Sam-8-22">Then Samuel dismissed the men of Israel: “Go home, each of you to your own city.”</span></p>
