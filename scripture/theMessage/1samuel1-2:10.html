He was descended from the old Zuph family in the Ephraim hills. His name was Elkanah. (He was connected with the Zuphs from Ephraim through his father Jeroham, his grandfather Elihu, and his great-grandfather Tohu.) He had two wives. The first was Hannah; the second was Peninnah. Peninnah had children; Hannah did not.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3201" class="text 1Sam-1-3-1Sam-1-7"><sup class="versenum">3-7&nbsp;</sup>Every year this man went from his hometown up to Shiloh to worship and offer a sacrifice to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, served as the priests of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> there. When Elkanah sacrificed, he passed helpings from the sacrificial meal around to his wife Peninnah and all her children, but he always gave an especially generous helping to Hannah because he loved her so much, and because <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had not given her children. But her rival wife taunted her cruelly, rubbing it in and never letting her forget that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had not given her children. This went on year after year. Every time she went to the sanctuary of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> she could expect to be taunted. Hannah was reduced to tears and had no appetite.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3202" class="text 1Sam-1-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Her husband Elkanah said, “Oh, Hannah, why are you crying? Why aren’t you eating? And why are you so upset? Am I not of more worth to you than ten sons?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3203" class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11"><sup class="versenum">9-11&nbsp;</sup>So Hannah ate. Then she pulled herself together, slipped away quietly, and entered the sanctuary. The priest Eli was on duty at the entrance to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s Temple in the customary seat. Crushed in soul, Hannah prayed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and cried and cried—inconsolably. Then she made a vow:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">Oh, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies,</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">If you’ll take a good, hard look at my pain,</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">If you’ll quit neglecting me and go into action for me</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">By giving me a son,</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">I’ll give him completely, unreservedly to you.</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-1-9-1Sam-1-11">I’ll set him apart for a life of holy discipline.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3204" class="text 1Sam-1-12-1Sam-1-14"><sup class="versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>It so happened that as she continued in prayer before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, Eli was watching her closely. Hannah was praying in her heart, silently. Her lips moved, but no sound was heard. Eli jumped to the conclusion that she was drunk. He approached her and said, “You’re drunk! How long do you plan to keep this up? Sober up, woman!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3205" class="text 1Sam-1-15-1Sam-1-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>Hannah said, “Oh no, sir—please! I’m a woman hard used. I haven’t been drinking. Not a drop of wine or beer. The only thing I’ve been pouring out is my heart, pouring it out to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. Don’t for a minute think I’m a bad woman. It’s because I’m so desperately unhappy and in such pain that I’ve stayed here so long.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3206" class="text 1Sam-1-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Eli answered her, “Go in peace. And may the God of Israel give you what you have asked of him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3207" class="text 1Sam-1-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>“Think well of me—and pray for me!” she said, and went her way. Then she ate heartily, her face radiant.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3208" class="text 1Sam-1-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Up before dawn, they worshiped <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and returned home to Ramah. Elkanah slept with Hannah his wife, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> began making the necessary arrangements in response to what she had asked.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-3209" class="text 1Sam-1-20">Dedicating the Child to God</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Sam-1-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>Before the year was out, Hannah had conceived and given birth to a son. She named him Samuel, explaining, “I asked <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> for him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3210" class="text 1Sam-1-21-1Sam-1-22"><sup class="versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>When Elkanah next took his family on their annual trip to Shiloh to worship <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, offering sacrifices and keeping his vow, Hannah didn’t go. She told her husband, “After the child is weaned, I’ll bring him myself and present him before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>—and that’s where he’ll stay, for good.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3211" class="text 1Sam-1-23-1Sam-1-24"><sup class="versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>Elkanah said to his wife, “Do what you think is best. Stay home until you have weaned him. Yes! Let <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> complete what he has begun!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-1-23-1Sam-1-24">So she did. She stayed home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. Then she took him up to Shiloh, bringing also the makings of a generous sacrificial meal—a prize bull, flour, and wine. The child was so young to be sent off!</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3212" class="text 1Sam-1-25-1Sam-1-26"><sup class="versenum">25-26&nbsp;</sup>They first butchered the bull, then brought the child to Eli. Hannah said, “Excuse me, sir. Would you believe that I’m the very woman who was standing before you at this very spot, praying to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>? I prayed for this child, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> gave me what I asked for. And now I have dedicated him to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. He’s dedicated to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> for life.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-1-25-1Sam-1-26">Then and there, they worshiped <span
