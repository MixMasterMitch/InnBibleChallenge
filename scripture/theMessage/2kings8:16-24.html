He was thirty-two years old when he began his rule, and was king for eight years in Jerusalem. He copied the way of life of the kings of Israel, marrying into the Ahab family and continuing the Ahab line of sin—from <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s point of view, an evil man living an evil life. But despite that, because of his servant David, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was not ready to destroy Judah. He had, after all, promised to keep a lamp burning through David’s descendants.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4518" class="text 2Kgs-8-20-2Kgs-8-21"><sup class="versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>During Jehoram’s reign, Edom revolted against Judah’s rule and set up their own king. Jehoram responded by taking his army of chariots to Zair.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-8-20-2Kgs-8-21">Edom surrounded him, but in the middle of the night he and his charioteers broke through the lines and hit Edom hard. But his infantry deserted him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4519" class="text 2Kgs-8-22"><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Edom continues in revolt against Judah right up to the present. Even little Libnah revolted at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4520" class="text 2Kgs-8-23-2Kgs-8-24"><sup class="versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>The rest of the life and times of Jehoram, the record of his rule, is written in <i>The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</i>. Jehoram died and was buried in the family grave in the City of David. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.</span></p>
