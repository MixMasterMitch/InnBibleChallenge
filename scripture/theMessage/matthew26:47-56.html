The betrayer had worked out a sign with them: “The one I kiss, that’s the one—seize him.” He went straight to Jesus, greeted him, “How are you, Rabbi?” and kissed him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10314" class="text Matt-26-50-Matt-26-51"><sup class="versenum">50-51&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, “Friend, why this charade?”</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-26-50-Matt-26-51">Then they came on him—grabbed him and roughed him up. One of those with Jesus pulled his sword and, taking a swing at the Chief Priest’s servant, cut off his ear.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10315" class="text Matt-26-52-Matt-26-54"><sup class="versenum">52-54&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, “Put your sword back where it belongs. All who use swords are destroyed by swords. Don’t you realize that I am able right now to call to my Father, and twelve companies—more, if I want them—of fighting angels would be here, battle-ready? But if I did that, how would the Scriptures come true that say this is the way it has to be?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10316" class="text Matt-26-55-Matt-26-56"><sup class="versenum">55-56&nbsp;</sup>Then Jesus addressed the mob: “What is this—coming out after me with swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous criminal? Day after day I have been sitting in the Temple teaching, and you never so much as lifted a hand against me. You’ve done it this way to confirm and fulfill the prophetic writings.”</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-26-55-Matt-26-56">Then all the disciples cut and ran.</span></p>
