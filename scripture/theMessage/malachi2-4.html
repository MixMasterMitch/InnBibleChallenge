If you refuse to obediently listen, and if you refuse to honor me, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies, in worship, then I’ll put you under a curse. I’ll exchange all your blessings for curses. In fact, the curses are already at work because you’re not serious about honoring me. Yes, and the curse will extend to your children. I’m going to plaster your faces with rotting garbage, garbage thrown out from your feasts. That’s what you have to look forward to!</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9864" class="text Mal-2-4-Mal-2-6"><sup class="versenum">4-6&nbsp;</sup>“Maybe that will wake you up. Maybe then you’ll realize that I’m indicting you in order to put new life into my covenant with the priests of Levi, the covenant of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. My covenant with Levi was to give life and peace. I kept my covenant with him, and he honored me. He stood in reverent awe before me. He taught the truth and did not lie. He walked with me in peace and uprightness. He kept many out of the ditch, kept them on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9865" class="text Mal-2-7-Mal-2-9"><sup class="versenum">7-9&nbsp;</sup>“It’s the job of priests to teach the truth. People are supposed to look to them for guidance. The priest is the messenger of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies. But you priests have abandoned the way of priests. Your teaching has messed up many lives. You have corrupted the covenant of priest Levi. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies says so. And so I am showing you up for who you are. Everyone will be disgusted with you and avoid you because you don’t live the way I told you to live, and you don’t teach my revelation truly and impartially.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9866" class="text Mal-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Don’t we all come from one Father?

Because <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was there as a witness when you spoke your marriage vows to your young bride, and now you’ve broken those vows, broken the faith-bond with your vowed companion, your covenant wife. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, not you, made marriage. His Spirit inhabits even the smallest details of marriage. And what does he want from marriage? Children of God, that’s what. So guard the spirit of marriage within you.
