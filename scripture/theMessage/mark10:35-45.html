I’ll see what I can do.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10546" class="text Mark-10-37"><sup class="versenum">37&nbsp;</sup>“Arrange it,” they said, “so that we will be awarded the highest places of honor in your glory—one of us at your right, the other at your left.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10547" class="text Mark-10-38"><sup class="versenum">38&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, “You have no idea what you’re asking. Are you capable of drinking the cup I drink, of being baptized in the baptism I’m about to be plunged into?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10548" class="text Mark-10-39-Mark-10-40"><sup class="versenum">39-40&nbsp;</sup>“Sure,” they said. “Why not?”</span></p><p><span class="text Mark-10-39-Mark-10-40">Jesus said, “Come to think of it, you <i>will</i> drink the cup I drink, and be baptized in my baptism. But as to awarding places of honor, that’s not my business. There are other arrangements for that.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10549" class="text Mark-10-41-Mark-10-45"><sup class="versenum">41-45&nbsp;</sup>When the other ten heard of this conversation, they lost their tempers with James and John. Jesus got them together to settle things down. “You’ve observed how godless rulers throw their weight around,” he said, “and when people get a little power how quickly it goes to their heads. It’s not going to be that way with you. Whoever wants to be great must become a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave. That is what the Son of Man has done: He came to serve, not to be served—and then to give away his life in exchange for many who are held hostage.”</span></p>
