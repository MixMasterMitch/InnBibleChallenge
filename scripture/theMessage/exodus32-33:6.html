Make gods for us who will lead us. That Moses, the man who got us out of Egypt—who knows what’s happened to him?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1181" class="text Exod-32-2-Exod-32-4"><sup class="versenum">2-4&nbsp;</sup>So Aaron told them, “Take off the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters and bring them to me.” They all did it; they removed the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from their hands and cast it in the form of a calf, shaping it with an engraving tool.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-32-2-Exod-32-4">The people responded with enthusiasm: “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from Egypt!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1182" class="text Exod-32-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Aaron, taking in the situation, built an altar before the calf.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-32-5">Aaron then announced, “Tomorrow is a feast day to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1183" class="text Exod-32-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Early the next morning, the people got up and offered Whole-Burnt-Offerings and brought Peace-Offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink and then began to party. It turned into a wild party!</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1184" class="text Exod-32-7-Exod-32-8"><sup class="versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoke to Moses, “Go! Get down there! Your people whom you brought up from the land of Egypt have fallen to pieces. In no time at all they’ve turned away from the way I commanded them: They made a molten calf and worshiped it. They’ve sacrificed to it and said, ‘These are the gods, O Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt!’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1185" class="text Exod-32-9-Exod-32-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Moses, “I look at this people—oh! what a stubborn, hard-headed people! Let me alone now, give my anger free reign to burst into flames and incinerate them. But I’ll make a great nation out of you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1186" class="text Exod-32-11-Exod-32-13"><sup class="versenum">11-13&nbsp;</sup>Moses tried to calm his <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> down. He said, “Why, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, would you lose your temper with your people? Why, you brought them out of Egypt in a tremendous demonstration of power and strength. Why let the Egyptians say, ‘He had it in for them—he brought them out so he could kill them in the mountains, wipe them right off the face of the Earth.’ Stop your anger. Think twice about bringing evil against your people! Think of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants to whom you gave your word, telling them ‘I will give you many children, as many as the stars in the sky, and I’ll give this land to your children as their land forever.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1187" class="text Exod-32-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>And <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> did think twice. He decided not to do the evil he had threatened against his people.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-1188" class="text Exod-32-15-Exod-32-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>Moses turned around and came down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of The Testimony. The tablets were written on both sides, front and back. God made the tablets and God wrote the tablets—engraved them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1189" class="text Exod-32-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting noisily, he said to Moses, “That’s the sound of war in the camp!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1190" class="text Exod-32-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>But Moses said,</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Exod-32-18">Those aren’t songs of victory,</span><br><span class="text Exod-32-18">And those aren’t songs of defeat,</span><br><span class="text Exod-32-18">I hear songs of people throwing a party.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-1191" class="text Exod-32-19-Exod-32-20"><sup class="versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>And that’s what it was. When Moses came near to the camp and saw the calf and the people dancing, his anger flared. He threw down the tablets and smashed them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. He took the calf that they had made, melted it down with fire, pulverized it to powder, then scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1192" class="text Exod-32-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “What on Earth did these people ever do to you that you involved them in this huge sin?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1193" class="text Exod-32-22-Exod-32-23"><sup class="versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>Aaron said, “Master, don’t be angry. You know this people and how set on evil they are. They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will lead us. This Moses, the man who brought us out of Egypt, we don’t know what’s happened to him.’</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1194" class="text Exod-32-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>“So I said, ‘Who has gold?’ And they took off their jewelry and gave it to me. I threw it in the fire and out came this calf.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1195" class="text Exod-32-25-Exod-32-26"><sup class="versenum">25-26&nbsp;</sup>Moses saw that the people were simply running wild—Aaron had let them run wild, disgracing themselves before their enemies. He took up a position at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is on <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s side, join me!” All the Levites stepped up.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1196" class="text Exod-32-27"><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>He then told them, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s orders, the God of Israel: ‘Strap on your swords and go to work. Crisscross the camp from one end to the other: Kill brother, friend, neighbor.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1197" class="text Exod-32-28"><sup class="versenum">28&nbsp;</sup>The Levites carried out Moses’ orders. Three thousand of the people were killed that day.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1198" class="text Exod-32-29"><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>Moses said, “You confirmed your ordination today—and at great cost, even killing your sons and brothers! And God has blessed you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1199" class="text Exod-32-30"><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>The next day Moses addressed the people: “You have sinned an enormous sin! But I am going to go up to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>; maybe I’ll be able to clear you of your sin.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1200" class="text Exod-32-31-Exod-32-32"><sup class="versenum">31-32&nbsp;</sup>Moses went back to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and said, “This is terrible. This people has sinned—it’s an enormous sin! They made gods of gold for themselves. And now, if you will only forgive their sin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But if not, erase me out of the book you’ve written.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1201" class="text Exod-32-33-Exod-32-34"><sup class="versenum">33-34&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Moses, “I’ll only erase from my book those who sin against me. For right now, you go and lead the people to where I told you. Look, my Angel is going ahead of you. On the day, though, when I settle accounts, their sins will certainly be part of the settlement.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1202" class="text Exod-32-35"><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> sent a plague on the people because of the calf they and Aaron had made.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1 chapter-2"><span id="en-MSG-1203" class="text Exod-33-1-Exod-33-3"><span class="chapternum">33&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-3&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Moses: “Now go. Get on your way from here, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt. Head for the land which I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I will send an angel ahead of you and I’ll drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. It’s a land flowing with milk and honey. But I won’t be with you in person—you’re such a stubborn, hard-headed people!—lest I destroy you on the journey.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1204" class="text Exod-33-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>When the people heard this harsh verdict, they were plunged into gloom and wore long faces. No one put on jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1205" class="text Exod-33-5-Exod-33-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You’re one hard-headed people. I couldn’t stand being with you for even a moment—I’d destroy you. So take off all your jewelry until I figure out what to do with you.’” So the Israelites stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb on.</span></p>
