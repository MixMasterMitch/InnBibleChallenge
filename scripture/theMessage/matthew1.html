His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. Before they came to the marriage bed, Joseph discovered she was pregnant. (It was by the Holy Spirit, but he didn’t know that.)

She will bring a son to birth, and when she does, you, Joseph, will name him Jesus—‘God saves’—because he will save his people from their sins.” This would bring the prophet’s embryonic sermon to full term:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Matt-1-20-Matt-1-23">Watch for this—a virgin will get pregnant and bear a son;</span><br><span class="text Matt-1-20-Matt-1-23">They will name him Immanuel (Hebrew for “God is with us”).</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-9891" class="text Matt-1-24-Matt-1-25"><sup class="versenum">24-25&nbsp;</sup>Then Joseph woke up. He did exactly what God’s angel commanded in the dream: He married Mary. But he did not consummate the marriage until she had the baby. He named the baby Jesus.</span></p>
