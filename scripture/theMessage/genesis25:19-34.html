Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan Aram. She was the sister of Laban the Aramean.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-334" class="text Gen-25-21-Gen-25-23"><sup class="versenum">21-23&nbsp;</sup>Isaac prayed hard to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> for his wife because she was barren. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> answered his prayer and Rebekah became pregnant. But the children tumbled and kicked inside her so much that she said, “If this is the way it’s going to be, why go on living?” She went to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> to find out what was going on. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told her,</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Gen-25-21-Gen-25-23">Two nations are in your womb,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Gen-25-21-Gen-25-23">two peoples butting heads while still in your body.</span></span><br><span class="text Gen-25-21-Gen-25-23">One people will overpower the other,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Gen-25-21-Gen-25-23">and the older will serve the younger.</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-335" class="text Gen-25-24-Gen-25-26"><sup class="versenum">24-26&nbsp;</sup>When her time to give birth came, sure enough, there were twins in her womb. The first came out reddish, as if snugly wrapped in a hairy blanket; they named him Esau (Hairy). His brother followed, his fist clutched tight to Esau’s heel; they named him Jacob (Heel). Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-336" class="text Gen-25-27-Gen-25-28"><sup class="versenum">27-28&nbsp;</sup>The boys grew up. Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob was a quiet man preferring life indoors among the tents. Isaac loved Esau because he loved his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-337" class="text Gen-25-29-Gen-25-30"><sup class="versenum">29-30&nbsp;</sup>One day Jacob was cooking a stew. Esau came in from the field, starved. Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stew—I’m starved!” That’s how he came to be called Edom (Red).</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-338" class="text Gen-25-31"><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Jacob said, “Make me a trade: my stew for your rights as the firstborn.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-339" class="text Gen-25-32"><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Esau said, “I’m starving!

On oath Esau traded away his rights as the firstborn. Jacob gave him bread and the stew of lentils. He ate and drank, got up and left. That’s how Esau shrugged off his rights as the firstborn.</span></p>
