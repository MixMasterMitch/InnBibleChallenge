Jesus took Peter and the brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain. His appearance changed from the inside out, right before their eyes. Sunlight poured from his face. His clothes were filled with light. Then they realized that Moses and Elijah were also there in deep conversation with him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10129" class="text Matt-17-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Peter broke in, “Master, this is a great moment! What would you think if I built three memorials here on the mountain—one for you, one for Moses, one for Elijah?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10130" class="text Matt-17-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>While he was going on like this, babbling, a light-radiant cloud enveloped them, and sounding from deep in the cloud a voice: “This is my Son, marked by my love, focus of my delight. Listen to him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10131" class="text Matt-17-6-Matt-17-8"><sup class="versenum">6-8&nbsp;</sup>When the disciples heard it, they fell flat on their faces, scared to death. But Jesus came over and touched them. “Don’t be afraid.” When they opened their eyes and looked around all they saw was Jesus, only Jesus.</span></p>
