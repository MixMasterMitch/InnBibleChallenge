The woman became pregnant and had a son. She saw there was something special about him and hid him. She hid him for three months. When she couldn’t hide him any longer she got a little basket-boat made of papyrus, waterproofed it with tar and pitch, and placed the child in it. Then she set it afloat in the reeds at the edge of the Nile.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-775" class="text Exod-2-4-Exod-2-6"><sup class="versenum">4-6&nbsp;</sup>The baby’s older sister found herself a vantage point a little way off and watched to see what would happen to him. Pharaoh’s daughter came down to the Nile to bathe; her maidens strolled on the bank. She saw the basket-boat floating in the reeds and sent her maid to get it. She opened it and saw the child—a baby crying! Her heart went out to him. She said, “This must be one of the Hebrew babies.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-776" class="text Exod-2-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Then his sister was before her: “Do you want me to go and get a nursing mother from the Hebrews so she can nurse the baby for you?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-777" class="text Exod-2-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Pharaoh’s daughter said, “Yes. Go.” The girl went and called the child’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-778" class="text Exod-2-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Pharaoh’s daughter told her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me. I’ll pay you.” The woman took the child and nursed him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-779" class="text Exod-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>After the child was weaned, she presented him to Pharaoh’s daughter who adopted him as her son. She named him Moses (Pulled-Out), saying, “I pulled him out of the water.”</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-780" class="text Exod-2-11-Exod-2-12"><sup class="versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>Time passed. Moses grew up. One day he went and saw his brothers, saw all that hard labor. Then he saw an Egyptian hit a Hebrew—one of his relatives! He looked this way and then that; when he realized there was no one in sight, he killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-781" class="text Exod-2-13"><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>The next day he went out there again. Two Hebrew men were fighting. He spoke to the man who started it: “Why are you hitting your neighbor?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-782" class="text Exod-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>The man shot back: “Who do you think you are, telling us what to do? Are you going to kill me the way you killed that Egyptian?”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-2-14">Then Moses panicked: “Word’s gotten out—people know about this.”</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-783" class="text Exod-2-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Pharaoh heard about it and tried to kill Moses, but Moses got away to the land of Midian. He sat down by a well.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-784" class="text Exod-2-16-Exod-2-17"><sup class="versenum">16-17&nbsp;</sup>The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, filling the troughs and watering their father’s sheep. When some shepherds came and chased the girls off, Moses came to their rescue and helped them water their sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-785" class="text Exod-2-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>When they got home to their father, Reuel, he said, “That didn’t take long. Why are you back so soon?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-786" class="text Exod-2-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>“An Egyptian,” they said, “rescued us from a bunch of shepherds. Why, he even drew water for us and watered the sheep.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-787" class="text Exod-2-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>He said, “So where is he? Why did you leave him behind? Invite him so he can have something to eat with us.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-788" class="text Exod-2-21-Exod-2-22"><sup class="versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>Moses agreed to settle down there with the man, who then gave his daughter Zipporah (Bird) to him for his wife. She had a son, and Moses named him Gershom (Sojourner), saying, “I’m a sojourner in a foreign country.”</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-789" class="text Exod-2-23"><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>Many years later the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery and cried out. Their cries for relief from their hard labor ascended to God:</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-790" class="text Exod-2-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>God listened to their groanings.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-2-24">God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-791" class="text Exod-2-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>God saw what was going on with Israel.</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-2-25">God understood.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1 chapter-1"><span id="en-MSG-792" class="text Exod-3-1-Exod-3-2"><span class="chapternum">3&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the west end of the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, Horeb. The angel of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> appeared to him in flames of fire blazing out of the middle of a bush. He looked. The bush was blazing away but it didn’t burn up.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-793" class="text Exod-3-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Moses said, “What’s going on here? I can’t believe this!

God called to him from out of the bush, “Moses! Moses!”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-3-4">He said, “Yes? I’m right here!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-795" class="text Exod-3-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>God said, “Don’t come any closer. Remove your sandals from your feet. You’re standing on holy ground.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-796" class="text Exod-3-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then he said, “I am the God of your father: The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-3-6">Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-797" class="text Exod-3-7-Exod-3-8"><sup class="versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “I’ve taken a good, long look at the affliction of my people in Egypt. I’ve heard their cries for deliverance from their slave masters; I know all about their pain. And now I have come down to help them, pry them loose from the grip of Egypt, get them out of that country and bring them to a good land with wide-open spaces, a land lush with milk and honey, the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-798" class="text Exod-3-9-Exod-3-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>“The Israelite cry for help has come to me, and I’ve seen for myself how cruelly they’re being treated by the Egyptians. It’s time for you to go back: I’m sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people, the People of Israel, out of Egypt.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-799" class="text Exod-3-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Moses answered God, “But why me? What makes you think that I could ever go to Pharaoh and lead the children of Israel out of Egypt?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-800" class="text Exod-3-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>“I’ll be with you,” God said. “And this will be the proof that I am the one who sent you: When you have brought my people out of Egypt, you will worship God right here at this very mountain.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-801" class="text Exod-3-13"><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Then Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the People of Israel and I tell them, ‘The God of your fathers sent me to you’; and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ What do I tell them?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-802" class="text Exod-3-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>God said to Moses, “I-AM-WHO-I-AM. Tell the People of Israel, ‘I-AM sent me to you.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-803" class="text Exod-3-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>God continued with Moses: “This is what you’re to say to the Israelites: ‘<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob sent me to you.’ This has always been my name, and this is how I always will be known.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-804" class="text Exod-3-16-Exod-3-17"><sup class="versenum">16-17&nbsp;</sup>“Now be on your way.

Then you and the leaders of Israel will go to the king of Egypt and say to him: ‘<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.

I’ll see to it that this people get a hearty send-off by the Egyptians—when you leave, you won’t leave empty-handed! Each woman will ask her neighbor and any guests in her house for objects of silver and gold, for jewelry and extra clothes; you’ll put them on your sons and daughters. Oh, you’ll clean the Egyptians out!”</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1 chapter-1"><span id="en-MSG-807" class="text Exod-4-1"><span class="chapternum">4&nbsp;</span>Moses objected, “They won’t trust me.

Hardly!’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-808" class="text Exod-4-2"><sup class="versenum">2&nbsp;</sup>So <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “What’s that in your hand?”</span></p><p><span class="text Exod-4-2">“A staff.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-809" class="text Exod-4-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>“Throw it on the ground.” He threw it.

His hand had turned leprous, like snow.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-812" class="text Exod-4-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>He said, “Put your hand back under your shirt.” He did it, then took it back out—as healthy as before.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-813" class="text Exod-4-8-Exod-4-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>“So if they don’t trust you and aren’t convinced by the first sign, the second sign should do it. But if it doesn’t, if even after these two signs they don’t trust you and listen to your message, take some water out of the Nile and pour it out on the dry land; the Nile water that you pour out will turn to blood when it hits the ground.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-814" class="text Exod-4-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Moses raised another objection to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: “Master, please, I don’t talk well. I’ve never been good with words, neither before nor after you spoke to me. I stutter and stammer.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-815" class="text Exod-4-11-Exod-4-12"><sup class="versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “And who do you think made the human mouth?

I’ll be right there with you—with your mouth!

He’s good with words, I know he is. He speaks very well. In fact, at this very moment he’s on his way to meet you. When he sees you he’s going to be glad. You’ll speak to him and tell him what to say. I’ll be right there with you as you speak and with him as he speaks, teaching you step by step. He will speak to the people for you. He’ll act as your mouth, but you’ll decide what comes out of it. Now take this staff in your hand; you’ll use it to do the signs.”</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-818" class="text Exod-4-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said, “I need to return to my relatives who are in Egypt.

Then you are to tell Pharaoh, ‘<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s Message: Israel is my son, my firstborn! I told you, “Free my son so that he can serve me.” But you refused to free him.

She said, “Oh! You’re a bridegroom of blood to me!” Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> let him go. She used the phrase “bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-823" class="text Exod-4-27-Exod-4-28"><sup class="versenum">27-28&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoke to Aaron, “Go and meet Moses in the wilderness.” He went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.
