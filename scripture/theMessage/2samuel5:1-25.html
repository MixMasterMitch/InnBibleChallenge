In time past when Saul was our king, you were the one who really ran the country. Even then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel and you’ll be the prince.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3701" class="text 2Sam-5-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>All the leaders of Israel met with King David at Hebron, and the king made a treaty with them in the presence of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. And so they anointed David king over Israel.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3702" class="text 2Sam-5-4-2Sam-5-5"><sup class="versenum">4-5&nbsp;</sup>David was thirty years old when he became king, and ruled for forty years. In Hebron he ruled Judah for seven and a half years. In Jerusalem he ruled all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3703" class="text 2Sam-5-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>David and his men immediately set out for Jerusalem to take on the Jebusites, who lived in that country. But they said, “You might as well go home! Even the blind and the lame could keep you out. You can’t get in here!” They had convinced themselves that David couldn’t break through.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3704" class="text 2Sam-5-7-2Sam-5-8"><sup class="versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>But David went right ahead and captured the fortress of Zion, known ever since as the City of David. That day David said, “To get the best of these Jebusites, one must target the water system, not to mention this so-called lame and blind bunch that David hates.” (In fact, he was so sick and tired of it, people coined the expression, “No lame and blind allowed in the palace.”)</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3705" class="text 2Sam-5-9-2Sam-5-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>David made the fortress city his home and named it “City of David.” He developed the city from the outside terraces inward. David proceeded with a longer stride, a larger embrace since the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies was with him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3706" class="text 2Sam-5-11-2Sam-5-12"><sup class="versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>It was at this time that Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, along with timbers of cedar. He also sent carpenters and masons to build a house for David. David took this as a sign that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had confirmed him as king of Israel, giving his kingship world prominence for the sake of Israel, his people.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3707" class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16"><sup class="versenum">13-16&nbsp;</sup>David took on more concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he left Hebron. And more sons and daughters were born to him. These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Shammua,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Shobab,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Nathan,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Solomon,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Ibhar,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Elishua,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Nepheg,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Japhia,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Elishama,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Eliada,</span><br><span class="text 2Sam-5-13-2Sam-5-16">Eliphelet.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3708" class="text 2Sam-5-17-2Sam-5-18"><sup class="versenum">17-18&nbsp;</sup>When the Philistines got word that David had been made king over all Israel, they came on the hunt for him. David heard of it and went down to the stronghold. When the Philistines arrived, they deployed their forces in Raphaim Valley.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3709" class="text 2Sam-5-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>Then David prayed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: “Shall I go up and fight the Philistines? Will you help me beat them?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3710" class="text 2Sam-5-20-2Sam-5-21"><sup class="versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>“Go up,” <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> replied. “Count on me. I’ll help you beat them.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-5-20-2Sam-5-21">David then went straight to Baal Perazim, and smashed them to pieces. Afterward David said, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> exploded on my enemies like a gush of water.” That’s why David named the place Baal Perazim (The-Master-Who-Explodes). The retreating Philistines dumped their idols, and David and his soldiers took them away.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3711" class="text 2Sam-5-22-2Sam-5-23"><sup class="versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>Later there was a repeat performance. The Philistines came up again and deployed their troops in the Rephaim Valley. David again prayed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3712" class="text 2Sam-5-23-2Sam-5-24"><sup class="versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>This time <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “Don’t attack them head-on. Instead, circle around behind them and ambush them from the grove of sacred trees. When you hear the sound of shuffling in the trees, get ready to move out. It’s a signal that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> is going ahead of you to smash the Philistine camp.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3713" class="text 2Sam-5-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>David did exactly what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told him. He routed the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.</span></p>
