The law was like those Greek tutors, with which you are familiar, who escort children to school and protect them from danger or distraction, making sure the children will really get to the place they set out for.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-12390" class="text Gal-3-25-Gal-3-27"><sup class="versenum">25-27&nbsp;</sup>But now you have arrived at your destination: By faith in Christ you are in direct relationship with God. Your baptism in Christ was not just washing you up for a fresh start. It also involved dressing you in an adult faith wardrobe—Christ’s life, the fulfillment of God’s original promise.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-12391" class="text Gal-3-28-Gal-3-29">In Christ’s Family</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Gal-3-28-Gal-3-29"><sup class="versenum">28-29&nbsp;</sup>In Christ’s family there can be no division into Jew and non-Jew, slave and free, male and female. Among us you are all equal. That is, we are all in a common relationship with Jesus Christ. Also, since you are Christ’s family, then you are Abraham’s famous “descendant,” heirs according to the covenant promises.</span></p>
