Now, listen again to what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> says. This is the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>-of-the-Angel-Armies speaking:</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3388" class="text 1Sam-15-2-1Sam-15-3"><sup class="versenum">2-3&nbsp;</sup>“‘I’m about to get even with Amalek for ambushing Israel when Israel came up out of Egypt. Here’s what you are to do: Go to war against Amalek. Put everything connected with Amalek under a holy ban. And no exceptions! This is to be total destruction—men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys—the works.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3389" class="text 1Sam-15-4-1Sam-15-5"><sup class="versenum">4-5&nbsp;</sup>Saul called the army together at Telaim and prepared them to go to war—two hundred companies of infantry from Israel and another ten companies from Judah. Saul marched to Amalek City and hid in the canyon.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3390" class="text 1Sam-15-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>Then Saul got word to the Kenites: “Get out of here while you can. Evacuate the city right now or you’ll get lumped in with the Amalekites. I’m warning you because you showed real kindness to the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-6">And they did. The Kenites evacuated the place.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3391" class="text 1Sam-15-7-1Sam-15-9"><sup class="versenum">7-9&nbsp;</sup>Then Saul went after Amalek, from the canyon all the way to Shur near the Egyptian border. He captured Agag, king of Amalek, alive. Everyone else was killed under the terms of the holy ban. Saul and the army made an exception for Agag, and for the choice sheep and cattle. They didn’t include them under the terms of the holy ban. But all the rest, which nobody wanted anyway, they destroyed as decreed by the holy ban.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3392" class="text 1Sam-15-10-1Sam-15-11"><sup class="versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoke to Samuel: “I’m sorry I ever made Saul king. He’s turned his back on me. He refuses to do what I tell him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3393" class="text 1Sam-15-11-1Sam-15-12"><sup class="versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>Samuel was angry when he heard this. He prayed his anger and disappointment all through the night. He got up early in the morning to confront Saul but was told, “Saul’s gone. He went to Carmel to set up a victory monument in his own honor, and then was headed for Gilgal.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-11-1Sam-15-12">By the time Samuel caught up with him, Saul had just finished an act of worship, having used Amalekite plunder for the burnt offerings sacrificed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3394" class="text 1Sam-15-13"><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>As Samuel came close, Saul called out, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s blessings on you! I accomplished <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s plan to the letter!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3395" class="text 1Sam-15-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Samuel said, “So what’s this I’m hearing—this bleating of sheep, this mooing of cattle?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3396" class="text 1Sam-15-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>“Only some Amalekite loot,” said Saul. “The soldiers saved back a few of the choice cattle and sheep to offer up in sacrifice to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. But everything else we destroyed under the holy ban.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3397" class="text 1Sam-15-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>“Enough!” interrupted Samuel. “Let me tell you what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told me last night.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-15-16">Saul said, “Go ahead. Tell me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3398" class="text 1Sam-15-17-1Sam-15-19"><sup class="versenum">17-19&nbsp;</sup>And Samuel told him. “When you started out in this, you were nothing—and you knew it. Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> put you at the head of Israel—made you king over Israel. Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> sent you off to do a job for him, ordering you, ‘Go and put those sinners, the Amalekites, under a holy ban. Go to war against them until you have totally wiped them out.’ So why did you not obey <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>? Why did you grab all this loot? Why, with <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s eyes on you all the time, did you brazenly carry out this evil?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3399" class="text 1Sam-15-20-1Sam-15-21"><sup class="versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>Saul defended himself. “What are you talking about? I did obey <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. I did the job <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> set for me. I brought in King Agag and destroyed the Amalekites under the terms of the holy ban. So the soldiers saved back a few choice sheep and cattle from the holy ban for sacrifice to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> at Gilgal—what’s wrong with that?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3400" class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23"><sup class="versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>Then Samuel said,</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">Do you think all <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> wants are sacrifices—</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">empty rituals just for show?</span></span><br><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">He wants you to listen to him!</span><br><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">Plain listening is the thing,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">not staging a lavish religious production.</span></span><br><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">Not doing what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> tells you</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">is far worse than fooling around in the occult.</span></span><br><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">Getting self-important around <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span></span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">is far worse than making deals with your dead ancestors.</span></span><br><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">Because you said No to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s command,</span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text 1Sam-15-22-1Sam-15-23">he says No to your kingship.</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3401" class="text 1Sam-15-24-1Sam-15-25"><sup class="versenum">24-25&nbsp;</sup>Saul gave in and confessed, “I’ve sinned. I’ve trampled roughshod over <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s Word and your instructions. I cared more about pleasing the people. I let them tell me what to do. Oh, absolve me of my sin! Take my hand and lead me to the altar so I can worship <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3402" class="text 1Sam-15-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>But Samuel refused: “No, I can’t come alongside you in this. You rejected <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s command. Now <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> has rejected you as king over Israel.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3403" class="text 1Sam-15-27-1Sam-15-29"><sup class="versenum">27-29&nbsp;</sup>As Samuel turned to leave, Saul grabbed at his priestly robe and a piece tore off. Samuel said, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> has just now torn the kingdom from you, and handed it over to your neighbor, a better man than you are. Israel’s God-of-Glory doesn’t deceive and he doesn’t dither. He says what he means and means what he says.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3404" class="text 1Sam-15-30"><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>Saul tried again, “I have sinned. But don’t abandon me! Support me with your presence before the leaders and the people. Come alongside me as I go back to worship <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3405" class="text 1Sam-15-31"><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>Samuel did. He went back with him. And Saul went to his knees before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and worshiped.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-3406" class="text 1Sam-15-32"><sup class="versenum">32&nbsp;</sup>Then Samuel said, “Present King Agag of Amalek to me.” Agag came, dragging his feet, muttering that he’d be better off dead.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3407" class="text 1Sam-15-33"><sup class="versenum">33&nbsp;</sup>Samuel said, “Just as your sword made many a woman childless, so your mother will be childless among those women!” And Samuel cut Agag down in the presence of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> right there in Gilgal.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3408" class="text 1Sam-15-34-1Sam-15-35"><sup class="versenum">34-35&nbsp;</sup>Samuel left immediately for Ramah and Saul went home to Gibeah. Samuel had nothing to do with Saul from then on, though he grieved long and deeply over him. But <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was sorry he had ever made Saul king in the first place.</span></p>
