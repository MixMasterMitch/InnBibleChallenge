This very day you are crossing the Jordan to enter the land and dispossess nations that are much bigger and stronger than you are. You’re going to find huge cities with sky-high fortress-walls and gigantic people, descendants of the Anakites—you’ve heard all about them; you’ve heard the saying, “No one can stand up to an Anakite.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2220" class="text Deut-9-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Today know this: <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, is crossing the river ahead of you—he’s a consuming fire. He will destroy the nations, he will put them under your power. You will dispossess them and very quickly wipe them out, just as <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> promised you would.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2221" class="text Deut-9-4-Deut-9-5"><sup class="versenum">4-5&nbsp;</sup>But when <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> pushes them out ahead of you, don’t start thinking to yourselves, “It’s because of all the good I’ve done that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> has brought me in here to dispossess these nations.” Actually it’s because of all the evil these nations have done. No, it’s nothing good that you’ve done, no record for decency that you’ve built up, that got you here; it’s because of the vile wickedness of these nations that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, is dispossessing them before you so that he can keep his promised word to your ancestors, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2222" class="text Deut-9-6-Deut-9-10"><sup class="versenum">6-10&nbsp;</sup>Know this and don’t ever forget it: It’s not because of any good that you’ve done that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> is giving you this good land to own. Anything but! You’re stubborn as mules. Keep in mind and don’t ever forget how angry you made <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, in the wilderness. You’ve kicked and screamed against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> from the day you left Egypt until you got to this place, rebels all the way. You made <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> angry at Horeb, made him so angry that he wanted to destroy you. When I climbed the mountain to receive the slabs of stone, the tablets of the covenant that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> made with you, I stayed there on the mountain forty days and nights: I ate no food; I drank no water. Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> gave me the two slabs of stone, engraved with the finger of God. They contained word for word everything that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoke to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2223" class="text Deut-9-11-Deut-9-12"><sup class="versenum">11-12&nbsp;</sup>It was at the end of the forty days and nights that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> gave me the two slabs of stone, the tablets of the covenant. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to me, “Get going, and quickly. Get down there, because your people whom you led out of Egypt have ruined everything. In almost no time at all they have left the road that I laid out for them and gone off and made for themselves a cast god.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2224" class="text Deut-9-13-Deut-9-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “I look at this people and all I see are hardheaded, hardhearted rebels. Get out of my way now so I can destroy them. I’m going to wipe them off the face of the map. Then I’ll start over with you to make a nation far better and bigger than they could ever be.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2225" class="text Deut-9-15-Deut-9-17"><sup class="versenum">15-17&nbsp;</sup>I turned around and started down the mountain—by now the mountain was blazing with fire—carrying the two tablets of the covenant in my two arms. That’s when I saw it: There you were, sinning against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God—you had made yourselves a cast god in the shape of a calf! So soon you had left the road that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had commanded you to walk on. I held the two stone slabs high and threw them down, smashing them to bits as you watched.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2226" class="text Deut-9-18-Deut-9-20"><sup class="versenum">18-20&nbsp;</sup>Then I prostrated myself before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, just as I had at the beginning of the forty days and nights. I ate no food; I drank no water. I did this because of you, all your sins, sinning against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, doing what is evil in <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s eyes and making him angry. I was terrified of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s furious anger, his blazing anger. I was sure he would destroy you. But once again <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> listened to me. And Aaron! How furious he was with Aaron—ready to destroy him. But I prayed also for Aaron at that same time.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2227" class="text Deut-9-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>But that sin-thing that you made, that calf-god, I took and burned in the fire, pounded and ground it until it was crushed into a fine powder, then threw it into the stream that comes down the mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2228" class="text Deut-9-22"><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>And then there was Camp Taberah (Blaze), Massah (Testing-Place), and Camp Kibroth Hattaavah (Graves-of-the-Craving)—more occasions when you made <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God </span>furious with you.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2229" class="text Deut-9-23-Deut-9-24"><sup class="versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>The most recent was when <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, ordering you: “Go. Possess the land that I’m giving you.” And what did you do? You rebelled. Rebelled against the clear orders of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God. Refused to trust him. Wouldn’t obey him. You’ve been rebels against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> from the first day I knew you.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2230" class="text Deut-9-25-Deut-9-26"><sup class="versenum">25-26&nbsp;</sup>When I was on my face, prostrate before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> those forty days and nights after <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said he would destroy you, I prayed to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> for you, “My Master, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, don’t destroy your people, your inheritance whom, in your immense generosity, you redeemed, using your enormous strength to get them out of Egypt.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2231" class="text Deut-9-27-Deut-9-28"><sup class="versenum">27-28&nbsp;</sup>“Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don’t make too much of the stubbornness of this people, their evil and their sin, lest the Egyptians from whom you rescued them say, ‘<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> couldn’t do it; he got tired and wasn’t able to take them to the land he promised them. He ended up hating them and dumped them in the wilderness to die.’</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-2232" class="text Deut-9-29"><sup class="versenum">29&nbsp;</sup>“They are your people still, your inheritance whom you powerfully and sovereignly rescued.”</span></p>
