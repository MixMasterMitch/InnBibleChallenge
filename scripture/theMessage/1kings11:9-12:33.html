Solomon faithlessly disobeyed <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s orders.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4144" class="text 1Kgs-11-11-1Kgs-11-13"><sup class="versenum">11-13&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Solomon, “Since this is the way it is with you, that you have no intention of keeping faith with me and doing what I have commanded, I’m going to rip the kingdom from you and hand it over to someone else. But out of respect for your father David I won’t do it in your lifetime. It’s your son who will pay—I’ll rip it right out of his grasp. Even then I won’t take it all; I’ll leave him one tribe in honor of my servant David and out of respect for my chosen city Jerusalem.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4145" class="text 1Kgs-11-14-1Kgs-11-20"><sup class="versenum">14-20&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> incited Hadad, a descendant of the king of Edom, into hostile actions against Solomon. Years earlier, when David devastated Edom, Joab, commander of the army, on his way to bury the dead, massacred all the men of Edom. Joab and his army stayed there for six months, making sure they had killed every man in Edom. Hadad, just a boy at the time, had escaped with some of the Edomites who had worked for his father. Their escape route took them through Midian to Paran. They picked up some men in Paran and went on to Egypt and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house, food, and even land. Pharaoh liked him so well that he gave him the sister of his wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage. She bore Hadad a son named Genubath who was raised like one of the royal family. Genubath grew up in the palace with Pharaoh’s children.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4146" class="text 1Kgs-11-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>While living in Egypt, Hadad heard that both David and Joab, commander of the army, were dead.

Hasn’t everything been to your liking?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-11-22">“Everything has been just fine,” said Hadad, “but I want to go home—give me a good send-off!”</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4148" class="text 1Kgs-11-23-1Kgs-11-25"><sup class="versenum">23-25&nbsp;</sup>Then God incited another adversary against Solomon, Rezon son of Eliada, who had deserted from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. After David’s slaughter of the Arameans, Rezon collected a band of outlaws and became their leader. They later settled in Damascus, where Rezon eventually took over as king. Like Hadad, Rezon was a thorn in Israel’s side all of Solomon’s life. He was king over Aram, and he hated Israel.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-4149" class="text 1Kgs-11-26">Adversaries Arise</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Kgs-11-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>And then, the last straw: Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was an Ephraimite from Zeredah, his mother a widow named Zeruah. He served in Solomon’s administration.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4150" class="text 1Kgs-11-27-1Kgs-11-28"><sup class="versenum">27-28&nbsp;</sup>This is why he rebelled. Solomon had built the outer defense system (the Millo) and had restored the fortifications that were in disrepair from the time of his father David. Jeroboam stood out during the construction as strong and able. When Solomon observed what a good worker he was, he put the young man in charge of the entire workforce of the tribe of Joseph.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4151" class="text 1Kgs-11-29-1Kgs-11-30"><sup class="versenum">29-30&nbsp;</sup>One day Jeroboam was walking down the road out of Jerusalem. Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh, wearing a brand-new cloak, met him. The two of them were alone on that remote stretch of road. Ahijah took off the new cloak that he was wearing and ripped it into twelve pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4152" class="text 1Kgs-11-31-1Kgs-11-33"><sup class="versenum">31-33&nbsp;</sup>Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten of these pieces for yourself; this is by order of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> of Israel: See what I’m doing—I’m ripping the kingdom out of Solomon’s hands and giving you ten of the tribes. In honor of my servant David and out of respect for Jerusalem, the city I especially chose, he will get one tribe. And here’s the reason: He faithlessly abandoned me and went off worshiping Ashtoreth goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh god of the Moabites, and Molech god of the Ammonites. He hasn’t lived the way I have shown him, hasn’t done what I have wanted, and hasn’t followed directions or obeyed orders as his father David did.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4153" class="text 1Kgs-11-34-1Kgs-11-36"><sup class="versenum">34-36&nbsp;</sup>“Still, I won’t take the whole kingdom away from him. I’ll stick with him through his lifetime because of my servant David whom I chose and who did follow my directions and obey my orders. But after that I’ll remove the kingdom from his son’s control and give you ten tribes. I’ll leave one tribe to his son, to maintain a witness to my servant David in Jerusalem, the city I chose as a memorial to my Name.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4154" class="text 1Kgs-11-37-1Kgs-11-39"><sup class="versenum">37-39&nbsp;</sup>“But I have taken you in hand. Rule to your heart’s content! You are to be the king of Israel. If you listen to what I tell you and live the way I show you and do what pleases me, following directions and obeying orders as my servant David did, I’ll stick with you no matter what. I’ll build you a kingdom as solid as the one I built for David. Israel will be yours! I am bringing pain and trouble on David’s descendants, but the trials won’t last forever.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4155" class="text 1Kgs-11-40"><sup class="versenum">40&nbsp;</sup>Solomon ordered the assassination of Jeroboam, but he got away to Egypt and found asylum there with King Shishak.

Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. He died and was buried in the City of David his father. His son Rehoboam was the next king.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-4157" class="text 1Kgs-12-1-1Kgs-12-2">Rehoboam</span></h3><p class="first-line-none chapter-2"><span class="text 1Kgs-12-1-1Kgs-12-2"><span class="chapternum">12&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>Rehoboam traveled to Shechem where all Israel had gathered to inaugurate him as king. Jeroboam had been in Egypt, where he had taken asylum from King Solomon; when he got the report of Solomon’s death he had come back.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4158" class="text 1Kgs-12-3-1Kgs-12-4"><sup class="versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>Rehoboam assembled Jeroboam and all the people. They said to Rehoboam, “Your father made life hard for us—worked our fingers to the bone. Give us a break; lighten up on us and we’ll willingly serve you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4159" class="text 1Kgs-12-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>“Give me three days to think it over, then come back,” Rehoboam said.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4160" class="text 1Kgs-12-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>King Rehoboam talked it over with the elders who had advised his father when he was alive: “What’s your counsel? How do you suggest that I answer the people?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4161" class="text 1Kgs-12-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>They said, “If you will be a servant to this people, be considerate of their needs and respond with compassion, work things out with them, they’ll end up doing anything for you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4162" class="text 1Kgs-12-8-1Kgs-12-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>But he rejected the counsel of the elders and asked the young men he’d grown up with who were now currying his favor, “What do you think? What should I say to these people who are saying, ‘Give us a break from your father’s harsh ways—lighten up on us’?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4163" class="text 1Kgs-12-10-1Kgs-12-11"><sup class="versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>The young turks he’d grown up with said, “These people who complain, ‘Your father was too hard on us; lighten up’—well, tell them this: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. If you think life under my father was hard, you haven’t seen the half of it. My father thrashed you with whips; I’ll beat you bloody with chains!’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4164" class="text 1Kgs-12-12-1Kgs-12-14"><sup class="versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>Three days later Jeroboam and the people showed up, just as Rehoboam had directed when he said, “Give me three days to think it over, then come back.” The king’s answer was harsh and rude. He spurned the counsel of the elders and went with the advice of the younger set, “If you think life under my father was hard, you haven’t seen the half of it. My father thrashed you with whips; I’ll beat you bloody with chains!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4165" class="text 1Kgs-12-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Rehoboam turned a deaf ear to the people. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was behind all this, confirming the message that he had given to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah of Shiloh.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4166" class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17"><sup class="versenum">16-17&nbsp;</sup>When all Israel realized that the king hadn’t listened to a word they’d said, they stood up to him and said,</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17">Get lost, David!</span><br><span class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17">We’ve had it with you, son of Jesse!</span><br><span class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17">Let’s get out of here, Israel, and fast!</span><br><span class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17">From now on, David, mind your own business.</span></p></div><p class="top-1"><span class="text 1Kgs-12-16-1Kgs-12-17">And with that, they left.

King Rehoboam jumped in his chariot and fled to Jerusalem as fast as he could. Israel has been in rebellion against the Davidic regime ever since.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-4168" class="text 1Kgs-12-20">Jeroboam of Israel</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Kgs-12-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>When the word was out that Jeroboam was back and available, the assembled people invited him and inaugurated him king over all Israel. The only tribe left to the Davidic dynasty was Judah.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4169" class="text 1Kgs-12-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>When Rehoboam got back to Jerusalem, he called up the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, a 180,000 of their best soldiers, to go to war against Israel and recover the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4170" class="text 1Kgs-12-22-1Kgs-12-24"><sup class="versenum">22-24&nbsp;</sup>At this time the word of God came to Shemaiah, a man of God: “Tell this to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, along with everyone in Judah and Benjamin and anyone else who is around: This is <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s word: Don’t march out; don’t fight against your brothers the Israelites; go back home, every last one of you; <i>I’m</i> in charge here.” And they did it; they did what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said and went home.</span></p> <p class="first-line-none top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4171" class="text 1Kgs-12-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Jeroboam made a fort at Shechem in the hills of Ephraim, and made that his headquarters. He also built a fort at Penuel.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4172" class="text 1Kgs-12-26-1Kgs-12-27"><sup class="versenum">26-27&nbsp;</sup>But then Jeroboam thought, “It won’t be long before the kingdom is reunited under David. As soon as these people resume worship at The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> in Jerusalem, they’ll start thinking of Rehoboam king of Judah as their ruler. They’ll then kill me and go back to King Rehoboam.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4173" class="text 1Kgs-12-28-1Kgs-12-30"><sup class="versenum">28-30&nbsp;</sup>So the king came up with a plan: He made two golden calves. Then he announced, “It’s too much trouble for you to go to Jerusalem to worship. Look at these—the gods who brought you out of Egypt!” He put one calf in Bethel; the other he placed in Dan. This was blatant sin. Think of it—people traveling all the way to Dan to worship a calf!</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4174" class="text 1Kgs-12-31-1Kgs-12-33"><sup class="versenum">31-33&nbsp;</sup>And that wasn’t the end of it. Jeroboam built forbidden shrines all over the place and recruited priests from wherever he could find them, regardless of whether they were fit for the job or not. To top it off, he created a holy New Year festival to be held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month to replace the one in Judah, complete with worship offered on the Altar at Bethel and sacrificing before the calves he had set up there. He staffed Bethel with priests from the local shrines he had made. This was strictly his own idea to compete with the feast in Judah; and he carried it off with flair, a festival exclusively for Israel, Jeroboam himself leading the worship at the Altar.</span></p>
