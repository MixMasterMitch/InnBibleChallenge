There is far more to your life than the food you put in your stomach, more to your outer appearance than the clothes you hang on your body. Look at the birds, free and unfettered, not tied down to a job description, careless in the care of God. And you count far more to him than birds.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9958" class="text Matt-6-27-Matt-6-29"><sup class="versenum">27-29&nbsp;</sup>“Has anyone by fussing in front of the mirror ever gotten taller by so much as an inch? All this time and money wasted on fashion—do you think it makes that much difference? Instead of looking at the fashions, walk out into the fields and look at the wildflowers. They never primp or shop, but have you ever seen color and design quite like it? The ten best-dressed men and women in the country look shabby alongside them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9959" class="text Matt-6-30-Matt-6-33"><sup class="versenum">30-33&nbsp;</sup>“If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers—most of which are never even seen—don’t you think he’ll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you? What I’m trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with <i>getting, </i>so you can respond to God’s <i>giving</i>. People who don’t know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don’t worry about missing out. You’ll find all your everyday human concerns will be met.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-9960" class="text Matt-6-34"><sup class="versenum">34&nbsp;</sup>“Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don’t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.</span></p>
