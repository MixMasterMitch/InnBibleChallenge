All the People of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The entire community was in on it: “Why didn’t we die in Egypt? Or in this wilderness? Why has <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> brought us to this country to kill us? Our wives and children are about to become plunder. Why don’t we just head back to Egypt? And right now!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1784" class="text Num-14-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Soon they were all saying it to one another: “Let’s pick a new leader; let’s head back to Egypt.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1785" class="text Num-14-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in front of the entire community, gathered in emergency session.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1786" class="text Num-14-6-Num-14-9"><sup class="versenum">6-9&nbsp;</sup>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, members of the scouting party, ripped their clothes and addressed the assembled People of Israel: “The land we walked through and scouted out is a very good land—very good indeed. If <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land that flows, as they say, with milk and honey. And he’ll give it to us. Just don’t rebel against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>! And don’t be afraid of those people. Why, we’ll have them for lunch! They have no protection and <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> is on our side. Don’t be afraid of them!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1787" class="text Num-14-10-Num-14-12"><sup class="versenum">10-12&nbsp;</sup>But, up in arms now, the entire community was talking of hurling stones at them.</span></p><p><span class="text Num-14-10-Num-14-12">Just then the bright Glory of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> appeared at the Tent of Meeting. Every Israelite saw it. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me like dirt? How long refuse to trust me? And with all these signs I’ve done among them! I’ve had enough—I’m going to hit them with a plague and kill them.

You delivered this people from Egypt with a great show of strength, and now this? The Egyptians will tell everyone. They’ve already heard that you are <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, that you are on the side of this people, that you are present among them, that they see you with their own eyes in your Cloud that hovers over them, in the Pillar of Cloud that leads them by day and the Pillar of Fire at night. If you kill this entire people in one stroke, all the nations that have heard what has been going on will say, ‘Since <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> couldn’t get these people into the land which he had promised to give them, he slaughtered them out in the wilderness.’</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1789" class="text Num-14-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>“Now, please, let the power of the Master expand, enlarge itself greatly, along the lines you have laid out earlier when you said,</span></p> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span id="en-MSG-1790" class="text Num-14-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, slow to get angry and huge in loyal love,</span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Num-14-18">forgiving iniquity and rebellion and sin;</span></span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Num-14-18">Still, never just whitewashing sin.</span></span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Num-14-18">But extending the fallout of parents’ sins</span></span><br><span class="indent-1"><span class="indent-1-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Num-14-18">to children into the third,</span></span><br><span class="indent-2"><span class="indent-2-breaks">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="text Num-14-18">even the fourth generation.</span></span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-1791" class="text Num-14-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>“Please forgive the wrongdoing of this people out of the extravagance of your loyal love just as all along, from the time they left Egypt, you have been forgiving this people.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1792" class="text Num-14-20-Num-14-23"><sup class="versenum">20-23&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “I forgive them, honoring your words.

No one who has treated me with such repeated contempt will see it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1793" class="text Num-14-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>“But my servant Caleb—this is a different story.

I’ve had my fill of complaints from these grumbling Israelites. Tell them, As I live—<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s decree—here’s what I’m going to do: Your corpses are going to litter the wilderness—every one of you twenty years and older who was counted in the census, this whole generation of grumblers and grousers. Not one of you will enter the land and make your home there, the firmly and solemnly promised land, except for Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1796" class="text Num-14-31-Num-14-34"><sup class="versenum">31-34&nbsp;</sup>“Your children, the very ones that you said would be taken for plunder, I’ll bring in to enjoy the land you rejected while your corpses will be rotting in the wilderness. These children of yours will live as shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, living with the fallout of your whoring unfaithfulness until the last of your generation lies a corpse in the wilderness. You scouted out the land for forty days; your punishment will be a year for each day, a forty-year sentence to serve for your sins—a long schooling in my displeasure.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-1797" class="text Num-14-35"><sup class="versenum">35&nbsp;</sup>“I, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, have spoken.

But the Chest of the Covenant and Moses didn’t budge from the camp. The Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in the hill country came out of the hills and attacked and beat them, a rout all the way down to Hormah.</span></p>
