Pharaoh’s daughter was only the first of the many foreign women he loved—Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite. He took them from the surrounding pagan nations of which <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had clearly warned Israel, “You must not marry them; they’ll seduce you into infatuations with their gods.” Solomon fell in love with them anyway, refusing to give them up. He had seven hundred royal wives and three hundred concubines—a thousand women in all! And they did seduce him away from God. As Solomon grew older, his wives beguiled him with their alien gods and he became unfaithful—he didn’t stay true to his <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> as his father David had done. Solomon took up with Ashtoreth, the whore goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech, the horrible god of the Ammonites.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4142" class="text 1Kgs-11-6-1Kgs-11-8"><sup class="versenum">6-8&nbsp;</sup>Solomon openly defied <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>; he did not follow in his father David’s footsteps. He went on to build a sacred shrine to Chemosh, the horrible god of Moab, and to Molech, the horrible god of the Ammonites, on a hill just east of Jerusalem. He built similar shrines for all his foreign wives, who then polluted the countryside with the smoke and stench of their sacrifices.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4143" class="text 1Kgs-11-9-1Kgs-11-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was furious with Solomon for abandoning the <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> of Israel, the God who had twice appeared to him and had so clearly commanded him not to fool around with other gods. Solomon faithlessly disobeyed <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s orders.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4144" class="text 1Kgs-11-11-1Kgs-11-13"><sup class="versenum">11-13&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said to Solomon, “Since this is the way it is with you, that you have no intention of keeping faith with me and doing what I have commanded, I’m going to rip the kingdom from you and hand it over to someone else. But out of respect for your father David I won’t do it in your lifetime. It’s your son who will pay—I’ll rip it right out of his grasp. Even then I won’t take it all; I’ll leave him one tribe in honor of my servant David and out of respect for my chosen city Jerusalem.”</span></p>
