<h3><span id="en-MSG-67" class="text Gen-6-1-Gen-6-2">Giants in the Land</span></h3><p class="first-line-none chapter-1"><span class="text Gen-6-1-Gen-6-2"><span class="chapternum">6&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-2&nbsp;</sup>When the human race began to increase, with more and more daughters being born, the sons of God noticed that the daughters of men were beautiful. They looked them over and picked out wives for themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-68" class="text Gen-6-3"><sup class="versenum">3&nbsp;</sup>Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “I’m not going to breathe life into men and women endlessly. Eventually they’re going to die; from now on they can expect a life span of 120 years.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-69" class="text Gen-6-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>This was back in the days (and also later) when there were giants in the land. The giants came from the union of the sons of God and the daughters of men. These were the mighty men of ancient lore, the famous ones.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-70" class="text Gen-6-5-Gen-6-7">Noah and His Sons</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Gen-6-5-Gen-6-7"><sup class="versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> saw that human evil was out of control. People thought evil, imagined evil—evil, evil, evil from morning to night. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was sorry that he had made the human race in the first place; it broke his heart. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “I’ll get rid of my ruined creation, make a clean sweep: people, animals, snakes and bugs, birds—the works. I’m sorry I made them.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-71" class="text Gen-6-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>But Noah was different. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> liked what he saw in Noah.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-72" class="text Gen-6-9-Gen-6-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>This is the story of Noah: Noah was a good man, a man of integrity in his community.

You are also to take two of each living creature, a male and a female, on board the ship, to preserve their lives with you: two of every species of bird, mammal, and reptile—two of everything so as to preserve their lives along with yours.
