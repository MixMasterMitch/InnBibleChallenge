He addressed the children of Israel, “This is <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s personal message to you:</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3311" class="text 1Sam-10-18-1Sam-10-19"><sup class="versenum">18-19&nbsp;</sup>“I brought Israel up out of Egypt. I delivered you from Egyptian oppression—yes, from all the bullying governments that made your life miserable. And now you want nothing to do with your God, the very God who has a history of getting you out of troubles of all sorts.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-18-1Sam-10-19">“And now you say, ‘No! We want a king; give us a king!’</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-18-1Sam-10-19">“Well, if that’s what you want, that’s what you’ll get! Present yourselves formally before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, ranked in tribes and families.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3312" class="text 1Sam-10-20-1Sam-10-21"><sup class="versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>After Samuel got all the tribes of Israel lined up, the Benjamin tribe was picked. Then he lined up the Benjamin tribe in family groups, and the family of Matri was picked. The family of Matri took its place in the lineup, and the name Saul, son of Kish, was picked. But when they went looking for him, he was nowhere to be found.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3313" class="text 1Sam-10-22"><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>Samuel went back to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>: “Is he anywhere around?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-22"><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “Yes, he’s right over there—hidden in that pile of baggage.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3314" class="text 1Sam-10-23"><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>They ran and got him. He took his place before everyone, standing tall—head and shoulders above them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3315" class="text 1Sam-10-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Samuel then addressed the people, “Take a good look at whom <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> has chosen: the best! No one like him in the whole country!”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-10-24">Then a great shout went up from the people: “Long live the king!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3316" class="text 1Sam-10-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Samuel went on to instruct the people in the rules and regulations involved in a kingdom, wrote it all down in a book, and placed it before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. Then Samuel sent everyone home.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3317" class="text 1Sam-10-26-1Sam-10-27"><sup class="versenum">26-27&nbsp;</sup>Saul also went home to Gibeah, and with him some true and brave men whom <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> moved to join him. But the riffraff went off muttering, “Deliverer? Don’t make me laugh!” They held him in contempt and refused to congratulate him. But Saul paid them no mind.</span></p><h3><span class="text 1Sam-10-26-1Sam-10-27">Saul Is Crowned King</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text 1Sam-10-26-1Sam-10-27">Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was brutalizing the tribes of Gad and Reuben, gouging out their right eyes and intimidating anyone who would come to Israel’s help. There were very few Israelites living on the east side of the Jordan River who had not had their right eyes gouged out by Nahash. But seven thousand men had escaped from the Ammonites and were now living safely in Jabesh.</span></p>
