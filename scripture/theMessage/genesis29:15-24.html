My flesh and blood!”</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-14-Gen-29-15">When Jacob had been with him for a month, Laban said, “Just because you’re my nephew, you shouldn’t work for me for nothing. Tell me what you want to be paid. What’s a fair wage?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-404" class="text Gen-29-16-Gen-29-18"><sup class="versenum">16-18&nbsp;</sup>Now Laban had two daughters; Leah was the older and Rachel the younger. Leah had nice eyes, but Rachel was stunningly beautiful. And it was Rachel that Jacob loved.</span></p><p><span class="text Gen-29-16-Gen-29-18">So Jacob answered, “I will work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-405" class="text Gen-29-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>“It is far better,” said Laban, “that I give her to you than marry her to some outsider. Yes. Stay here with me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-406" class="text Gen-29-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel. But it only seemed like a few days, he loved her so much.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-407" class="text Gen-29-21-Gen-29-24"><sup class="versenum">21-24&nbsp;</sup>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife; I’ve completed what we agreed I’d do. I’m ready to consummate my marriage.” Laban invited everyone around and threw a big feast. At evening, though, he got his daughter Leah and brought her to the marriage bed, and Jacob slept with her. (Laban gave his maid Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.)</span></p>
