The Temple that King Solomon built to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high. There was a porch across the thirty-foot width of The Temple that extended out fifteen feet. Within The Temple he made narrow, deep-silled windows. Against the outside walls he built a supporting structure in which there were smaller rooms: The lower floor was seven and a half feet wide, the middle floor nine feet, and the third floor ten and a half feet. He had projecting ledges built into the outside Temple walls to support the buttressing beams.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4066" class="text 1Kgs-6-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The stone blocks for the building of The Temple were all dressed at the quarry so that the building site itself was reverently quiet—no noise from hammers and chisels and other iron tools.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4067" class="text 1Kgs-6-8-1Kgs-6-10"><sup class="versenum">8-10&nbsp;</sup>The entrance to the ground floor was at the south end of The Temple; stairs led to the second floor and then to the third. Solomon built and completed The Temple, finishing it off with roof beams and planks of cedar. The supporting structure along the outside walls was attached to The Temple with cedar beams and the rooms in it were seven and a half feet tall.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4068" class="text 1Kgs-6-11-1Kgs-6-13"><sup class="versenum">11-13&nbsp;</sup>The word of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> came to Solomon saying, “About this Temple you are building—what’s important is that you <i>live</i> the way I’ve set out for you and <i>do</i> what I tell you, following my instructions carefully and obediently. Then I’ll complete in you the promise I made to David your father. I’ll personally take up my residence among the Israelites—I won’t desert my people Israel.”</span></p>
