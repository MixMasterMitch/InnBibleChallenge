You know I’ve rejected him as king over Israel. Fill your flask with anointing oil and get going. I’m sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I’ve spotted the very king I want among his sons.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3410" class="text 1Sam-16-2-1Sam-16-3"><sup class="versenum">2-3&nbsp;</sup>“I can’t do that,” said Samuel. “Saul will hear about it and kill me.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-2-1Sam-16-3"><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “Take a heifer with you and announce, ‘I’ve come to lead you in worship of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, with this heifer as a sacrifice.’ Make sure Jesse gets invited. I’ll let you know what to do next. I’ll point out the one you are to anoint.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3411" class="text 1Sam-16-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>Samuel did what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told him. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the town fathers greeted him, but apprehensively. “Is there something wrong?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3412" class="text 1Sam-16-5"><sup class="versenum">5&nbsp;</sup>“Nothing’s wrong. I’ve come to sacrifice this heifer and lead you in the worship of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. Prepare yourselves, be consecrated, and join me in worship.” He made sure Jesse and his sons were also consecrated and called to worship.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3413" class="text 1Sam-16-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, “Here he is! <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s anointed!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3414" class="text 1Sam-16-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>But <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> told Samuel, “Looks aren’t everything. Don’t be impressed with his looks and stature. I’ve already eliminated him. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> judges persons differently than humans do. Men and women look at the face; <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> looks into the heart.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3415" class="text 1Sam-16-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Jesse then called up Abinadab and presented him to Samuel. Samuel said, “This man isn’t <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s choice either.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3416" class="text 1Sam-16-9"><sup class="versenum">9&nbsp;</sup>Next Jesse presented Shammah. Samuel said, “No, this man isn’t either.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3417" class="text 1Sam-16-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>Jesse presented his seven sons to Samuel. Samuel was blunt with Jesse, “<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> hasn’t chosen any of these.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3418" class="text 1Sam-16-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then he asked Jesse, “Is this it? Are there no more sons?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-11">“Well, yes, there’s the runt. But he’s out tending the sheep.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-11">Samuel ordered Jesse, “Go get him. We’re not moving from this spot until he’s here.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3419" class="text 1Sam-16-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Jesse sent for him. He was brought in, the very picture of health—bright-eyed, good-looking.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-12"><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> said, “Up on your feet! Anoint him! This is the one.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3420" class="text 1Sam-16-13"><sup class="versenum">13&nbsp;</sup>Samuel took his flask of oil and anointed him, with his brothers standing around watching. The Spirit of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> entered David like a rush of wind, God vitally empowering him for the rest of his life.</span></p><p><span class="text 1Sam-16-13">Samuel left and went home to Ramah.</span></p>
