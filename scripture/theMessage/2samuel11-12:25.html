They laid siege to Rabbah, but David stayed in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3764" class="text 2Sam-11-2-2Sam-11-5"><sup class="versenum">2-5&nbsp;</sup>One late afternoon, David got up from taking his nap and was strolling on the roof of the palace. From his vantage point on the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was stunningly beautiful. David sent to ask about her, and was told, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of Uriah the Hittite?” David sent his agents to get her. After she arrived, he went to bed with her. (This occurred during the time of “purification” following her period.) Then she returned home. Before long she realized she was pregnant.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-11-2-2Sam-11-5">Later she sent word to David: “I’m pregnant.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3765" class="text 2Sam-11-6"><sup class="versenum">6&nbsp;</sup>David then got in touch with Joab: “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” Joab sent him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3766" class="text 2Sam-11-7-2Sam-11-8"><sup class="versenum">7-8&nbsp;</sup>When he arrived, David asked him for news from the front—how things were going with Joab and the troops and with the fighting. Then he said to Uriah, “Go home. Have a refreshing bath and a good night’s rest.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3767" class="text 2Sam-11-8-2Sam-11-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>After Uriah left the palace, an informant of the king was sent after him. But Uriah didn’t go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance, along with the king’s servants.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3768" class="text 2Sam-11-10"><sup class="versenum">10&nbsp;</sup>David was told that Uriah had not gone home. He asked Uriah, “Didn’t you just come off a hard trip? So why didn’t you go home?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3769" class="text 2Sam-11-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Uriah replied to David, “The Chest is out there with the fighting men of Israel and Judah—in tents. My master Joab and his servants are roughing it out in the fields. So, how can I go home and eat and drink and enjoy my wife? On your life, I’ll not do it!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3770" class="text 2Sam-11-12-2Sam-11-13"><sup class="versenum">12-13&nbsp;</sup>“All right,” said David, “have it your way. Stay for the day and I’ll send you back tomorrow.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem the rest of the day.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-11-12-2Sam-11-13">The next day David invited him to eat and drink with him, and David got him drunk. But in the evening Uriah again went out and slept with his master’s servants. He didn’t go home.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3771" class="text 2Sam-11-14-2Sam-11-15"><sup class="versenum">14-15&nbsp;</sup>In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. In the letter he wrote, “Put Uriah in the front lines where the fighting is the fiercest. Then pull back and leave him exposed so that he’s sure to be killed.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3772" class="text 2Sam-11-16-2Sam-11-17"><sup class="versenum">16-17&nbsp;</sup>So Joab, holding the city under siege, put Uriah in a place where he knew there were fierce enemy fighters. When the city’s defenders came out to fight Joab, some of David’s soldiers were killed, including Uriah the Hittite.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3773" class="text 2Sam-11-18-2Sam-11-21"><sup class="versenum">18-21&nbsp;</sup>Joab sent David a full report on the battle. He instructed the messenger, “After you have given to the king a detailed report on the battle, if he flares in anger, say, ‘And by the way, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3774" class="text 2Sam-11-22-2Sam-11-24"><sup class="versenum">22-24&nbsp;</sup>Joab’s messenger arrived in Jerusalem and gave the king a full report. He said, “The enemy was too much for us. They advanced on us in the open field, and we pushed them back to the city gate. But then arrows came hot and heavy on us from the city wall, and eighteen of the king’s soldiers died.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3775" class="text 2Sam-11-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>When the messenger completed his report of the battle, David got angry at Joab. He vented it on the messenger: “Why did you get so close to the city? Didn’t you know you’d be attacked from the wall? Didn’t you remember how Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth got killed? Wasn’t it a woman who dropped a millstone on him from the wall and crushed him at Thebez? Why did you go close to the wall!”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-11-25">“By the way,” said Joab’s messenger, “your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-11-25">Then David told the messenger, “Oh. I see. Tell Joab, ‘Don’t trouble yourself over this. War kills—sometimes one, sometimes another—you never know who’s next. Redouble your assault on the city and destroy it.’ Encourage Joab.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3776" class="text 2Sam-11-26-2Sam-11-27"><sup class="versenum">26-27&nbsp;</sup>When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she grieved for her husband. When the time of mourning was over, David sent someone to bring her to his house. She became his wife and bore him a son.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3777" class="text 2Sam-11-27"><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>But <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was not at all pleased with what David had done, </span> <span id="en-MSG-3778" class="text 2Sam-12-1-2Sam-12-3"><span class="chapternum mid-paragraph">12&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum mid-paragraph">1-3&nbsp;</sup>and sent Nathan to David. Nathan said to him, “There were two men in the same city—one rich, the other poor. The rich man had huge flocks of sheep, herds of cattle. The poor man had nothing but one little female lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up with him and his children as a member of the family. It ate off his plate and drank from his cup and slept on his bed. It was like a daughter to him.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3779" class="text 2Sam-12-4"><sup class="versenum">4&nbsp;</sup>“One day a traveler dropped in on the rich man. He was too stingy to take an animal from his own herds or flocks to make a meal for his visitor, so he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared a meal to set before his guest.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3780" class="text 2Sam-12-5-2Sam-12-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>David exploded in anger. “As surely as <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> lives,” he said to Nathan, “the man who did this ought to be lynched! He must repay for the lamb four times over for his crime and his stinginess!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3781" class="text 2Sam-12-7-2Sam-12-12"><sup class="versenum">7-12&nbsp;</sup>“You’re the man!” said Nathan. “And here’s what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, the God of Israel, has to say to you: I made you king over Israel. I freed you from the fist of Saul. I gave you your master’s daughter and other wives to have and to hold. I gave you both Israel and Judah. And if that hadn’t been enough, I’d have gladly thrown in much more. So why have you treated the word of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> with brazen contempt, doing this great evil? You murdered Uriah the Hittite, then took his wife as your wife. Worse, you killed him with an Ammonite sword! And now, because you treated God with such contempt and took Uriah the Hittite’s wife as your wife, killing and murder will continually plague your family. This is <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God </span>speaking, remember! I’ll make trouble for you out of your own family. I’ll take your wives from right out in front of you. I’ll give them to some neighbor, and he’ll go to bed with them openly. You did your deed in secret; I’m doing mine with the whole country watching!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3782" class="text 2Sam-12-13-2Sam-12-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>Then David confessed to Nathan, “I’ve sinned against <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-13-2Sam-12-14">Nathan pronounced, “Yes, but that’s not the last word. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> forgives your sin. You won’t die for it. But because of your blasphemous behavior, the son born to you will die.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3783" class="text 2Sam-12-15-2Sam-12-18"><sup class="versenum">15-18&nbsp;</sup>After Nathan went home, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> afflicted the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and he came down sick. David prayed desperately to God for the little boy. He fasted, wouldn’t go out, and slept on the floor. The elders in his family came in and tried to get him off the floor, but he wouldn’t budge. Nor could they get him to eat anything. On the seventh day the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him. They said, “What do we do now? While the child was living he wouldn’t listen to a word we said. Now, with the child dead, if we speak to him there’s no telling what he’ll do.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3784" class="text 2Sam-12-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>David noticed that the servants were whispering behind his back, and realized that the boy must have died.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-19">He asked the servants, “Is the boy dead?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Sam-12-19">“Yes,” they answered. “He’s dead.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3785" class="text 2Sam-12-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>David got up from the floor, washed his face and combed his hair, put on a fresh change of clothes, then went into the sanctuary and worshiped. Then he came home and asked for something to eat. They set it before him and he ate.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3786" class="text 2Sam-12-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>His servants asked him, “What’s going on with you? While the child was alive you fasted and wept and stayed up all night. Now that he’s dead, you get up and eat.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3787" class="text 2Sam-12-22-2Sam-12-23"><sup class="versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>“While the child was alive,” he said, “I fasted and wept, thinking <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> might have mercy on me and the child would live. But now that he’s dead, why fast? Can I bring him back now? I can go to him, but he can’t come to me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-3788" class="text 2Sam-12-24-2Sam-12-25"><sup class="versenum">24-25&nbsp;</sup>David went and comforted his wife Bathsheba. And when he slept with her, they conceived a son. When he was born they named him Solomon. <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> had a special love for him and sent word by Nathan the prophet that <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> wanted him named Jedidiah (God’s Beloved).</span></p>
