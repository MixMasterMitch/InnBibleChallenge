Zadok the priest brought a flask of oil from the sanctuary and anointed Solomon. They blew the ram’s horn trumpet and everyone shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” Everyone joined the fanfare, the band playing and the people singing, the very earth reverberating to the sound.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4002" class="text 1Kgs-1-41"><sup class="versenum">41&nbsp;</sup>Adonijah and his retinue of guests were just finishing their “coronation” feast when they heard it.

Our master King David has just made Solomon king! And the king has surrounded him with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, with the Kerethites and Pelethites; and they’ve mounted Solomon on the royal mule. Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon and the parade is headed up this way singing—a great fanfare! The city is rocking! That’s what you’re hearing. Here’s the crowning touch—Solomon is seated on the throne of the kingdom! And that’s not all: The king’s servants have come to give their blessing to our master King David saying, ‘God make Solomon’s name even more honored than yours, and make his rule greater than yours!’ On his deathbed the king worshiped God and prayed, ‘Blessed be <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, Israel’s God, who has provided a successor to my throne, and I’ve lived to see it!’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4005" class="text 1Kgs-1-49-1Kgs-1-50"><sup class="versenum">49-50&nbsp;</sup>Panicked, Adonijah’s guests got out of there, scattering every which way.

Solomon dismissed him, “Go home.”</span></p> <p class="chapter-1"><span id="en-MSG-4008" class="text 1Kgs-2-1-1Kgs-2-4"><span class="chapternum">2&nbsp;</span><sup class="versenum">1-4&nbsp;</sup>When David’s time to die approached, he charged his son Solomon, saying, “I’m about to go the way of all the earth, but you—be strong; show what you’re made of!

Then <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> will confirm what he promised me when he said, ‘If your sons watch their step, staying true to me heart and soul, you’ll always have a successor on Israel’s throne.’</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4009" class="text 1Kgs-2-5-1Kgs-2-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>“And don’t forget what Joab son of Zeruiah did to the two commanders of Israel’s army, to Abner son of Ner and to Amasa son of Jether.
