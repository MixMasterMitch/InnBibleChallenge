Hezekiah was pleased and showed the messengers around the place—silver, gold, spices, aromatic oils, his stockpile of weapons—a guided tour of all his prized possessions. There wasn’t a thing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah didn’t show them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4726" class="text 2Kgs-20-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>And then Isaiah the prophet showed up: “And just what were these men doing here?
