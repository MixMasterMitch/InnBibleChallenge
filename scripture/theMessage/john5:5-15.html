Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem there was a pool, in Hebrew called <i>Bethesda</i>, with five alcoves. Hundreds of sick people—blind, crippled, paralyzed—were in these alcoves. One man had been an invalid there for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him stretched out by the pool and knew how long he had been there, he said, “Do you want to get well?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11251" class="text John-5-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>The sick man said, “Sir, when the water is stirred, I don’t have anybody to put me in the pool. By the time I get there, somebody else is already in.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11252" class="text John-5-8-John-5-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, “Get up, take your bedroll, start walking.” The man was healed on the spot. He picked up his bedroll and walked off.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11253" class="text John-5-9-John-5-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>That day happened to be the Sabbath. The Jews stopped the healed man and said, “It’s the Sabbath. You can’t carry your bedroll around. It’s against the rules.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11254" class="text John-5-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>But he told them, “The man who made me well told me to. He said, ‘Take your bedroll and start walking.’”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11255" class="text John-5-12-John-5-13"><sup class="versenum">12-13&nbsp;</sup>They asked, “Who gave you the order to take it up and start walking?” But the healed man didn’t know, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11256" class="text John-5-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>A little later Jesus found him in the Temple and said, “You look wonderful! You’re well! Don’t return to a sinning life or something worse might happen.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11257" class="text John-5-15-John-5-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>The man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. That is why the Jews were out to get Jesus—because he did this kind of thing on the Sabbath.</span></p>
