I looked them over and found that they were all laymen and priests but no Levites. So I sent for the leaders Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, and for the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan. I then sent them to Iddo, who is head of the town of Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives who lived there in Casiphia: “Send us ministers for The Temple of God.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5479" class="text Ezra-8-18-Ezra-8-20"><sup class="versenum">18-20&nbsp;</sup>Well, the generous hand of our God was on us, and they brought back to us a wise man from the family of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel. His name was Sherebiah. With sons and brothers they numbered eighteen. They also brought Hashabiah and Jeshaiah of the family of Merari, with brothers and their sons, another twenty. And then there were 220 temple servants, descendants of the temple servants that David and the princes had assigned to help the Levites in their work. They were all signed up by name.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5480" class="text Ezra-8-21-Ezra-8-22"><sup class="versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>I proclaimed a fast there beside the Ahava Canal, a fast to humble ourselves before our God and pray for wise guidance for our journey—all our people and possessions. I was embarrassed to ask the king for a cavalry bodyguard to protect us from bandits on the road. We had just told the king, “Our God lovingly looks after all those who seek him, but turns away in disgust from those who leave him.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5481" class="text Ezra-8-23"><sup class="versenum">23&nbsp;</sup>So we fasted and prayed about these concerns.

I weighed out for them the silver, the gold, the vessels, and the offerings for The Temple of our God that the king, his advisors, and all the Israelites had given:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Ezra-8-24-Ezra-8-27">25 tons of silver</span><br><span class="text Ezra-8-24-Ezra-8-27">100 vessels of silver valued at three and three-quarter tons of gold</span><br><span class="text Ezra-8-24-Ezra-8-27">20 gold bowls weighing eighteen and a half pounds</span><br><span class="text Ezra-8-24-Ezra-8-27">2 vessels of bright red copper, as valuable as gold.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-5483" class="text Ezra-8-28-Ezra-8-29"><sup class="versenum">28-29&nbsp;</sup>I said to them, “You are holy to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> and these vessels are holy.

Guard them with your lives until you’re able to weigh them out in a secure place in The Temple of our God for the priests and Levites and family heads who are in charge in Jerusalem.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-5484" class="text Ezra-8-30"><sup class="versenum">30&nbsp;</sup>The priests and Levites took charge of all that had been weighed out to them, and prepared to deliver it to Jerusalem to The Temple of our God.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-5485" class="text Ezra-8-31"><sup class="versenum">31&nbsp;</sup>We left the Ahava Canal on the twelfth day of the first month to travel to Jerusalem.
