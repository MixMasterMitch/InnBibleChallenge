There was a man there, his name Zacchaeus, the head tax man and quite rich. He wanted desperately to see Jesus, but the crowd was in his way—he was a short man and couldn’t see over the crowd. So he ran on ahead and climbed up in a sycamore tree so he could see Jesus when he came by.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11026" class="text Luke-19-5-Luke-19-7"><sup class="versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>When Jesus got to the tree, he looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, hurry down. Today is my day to be a guest in your home.” Zacchaeus scrambled out of the tree, hardly believing his good luck, delighted to take Jesus home with him. Everyone who saw the incident was indignant and grumped, “What business does he have getting cozy with this crook?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11027" class="text Luke-19-8"><sup class="versenum">8&nbsp;</sup>Zacchaeus just stood there, a little stunned. He stammered apologetically, “Master, I give away half my income to the poor—and if I’m caught cheating, I pay four times the damages.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-11028" class="text Luke-19-9-Luke-19-10"><sup class="versenum">9-10&nbsp;</sup>Jesus said, “Today is salvation day in this home! Here he is: Zacchaeus, son of Abraham! For the Son of Man came to find and restore the lost.”</span></p>
