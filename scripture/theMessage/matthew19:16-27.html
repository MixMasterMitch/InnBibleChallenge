If you want to enter the life of God, just do what he tells you.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10168" class="text Matt-19-18-Matt-19-19"><sup class="versenum">18-19&nbsp;</sup>The man asked, “What in particular?”</span></p><p><span class="text Matt-19-18-Matt-19-19">Jesus said, “Don’t murder, don’t commit adultery, don’t steal, don’t lie, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as you do yourself.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10169" class="text Matt-19-20"><sup class="versenum">20&nbsp;</sup>The young man said, “I’ve done all that. What’s left?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10170" class="text Matt-19-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>“If you want to give it all you’ve got,” Jesus replied, “go sell your possessions; give everything to the poor. All your wealth will then be in heaven. Then come follow me.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10171" class="text Matt-19-22"><sup class="versenum">22&nbsp;</sup>That was the last thing the young man expected to hear. And so, crestfallen, he walked away. He was holding on tight to a lot of things, and he couldn’t bear to let go.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10172" class="text Matt-19-23-Matt-19-24"><sup class="versenum">23-24&nbsp;</sup>As he watched him go, Jesus told his disciples, “Do you have any idea how difficult it is for the rich to enter God’s kingdom? Let me tell you, it’s easier to gallop a camel through a needle’s eye than for the rich to enter God’s kingdom.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10173" class="text Matt-19-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>The disciples were staggered. “Then who has any chance at all?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10174" class="text Matt-19-26"><sup class="versenum">26&nbsp;</sup>Jesus looked hard at them and said, “No chance at all if you think you can pull it off yourself. Every chance in the world if you trust God to do it.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10175" class="text Matt-19-27"><sup class="versenum">27&nbsp;</sup>Then Peter chimed in, “We left everything and followed you. What do we get out of it?”</span></p>
