Since I have investigated all the reports in close detail, starting from the story’s beginning, I decided to write it all out for you, most honorable Theophilus, so you can know beyond the shadow of a doubt the reliability of what you were taught.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-10664" class="text Luke-1-5-Luke-1-7">A Childless Couple Conceives</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Luke-1-5-Luke-1-7"><sup class="versenum">5-7&nbsp;</sup>During the rule of Herod, King of Judea, there was a priest assigned service in the regiment of Abijah. His name was Zachariah. His wife was descended from the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth. Together they lived honorably before God, careful in keeping to the ways of the commandments and enjoying a clear conscience before God. But they were childless because Elizabeth could never conceive, and now they were quite old.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10665" class="text Luke-1-8-Luke-1-12"><sup class="versenum">8-12&nbsp;</sup>It so happened that as Zachariah was carrying out his priestly duties before God, working the shift assigned to his regiment, it came his one turn in life to enter the sanctuary of God and burn incense. The congregation was gathered and praying outside the Temple at the hour of the incense offering. Unannounced, an angel of God appeared just to the right of the altar of incense. Zachariah was paralyzed in fear.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10666" class="text Luke-1-13-Luke-1-15"><sup class="versenum">13-15&nbsp;</sup>But the angel reassured him, “Don’t fear, Zachariah. Your prayer has been heard. Elizabeth, your wife, will bear a son by you. You are to name him John. You’re going to leap like a gazelle for joy, and not only you—many will delight in his birth. He’ll achieve great stature with God.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10667" class="text Luke-1-15-Luke-1-17"><sup class="versenum">15-17&nbsp;</sup>“He’ll drink neither wine nor beer. He’ll be filled with the Holy Spirit from the moment he leaves his mother’s womb. He will turn many sons and daughters of Israel back to their God. He will herald God’s arrival in the style and strength of Elijah, soften the hearts of parents to children, and kindle devout understanding among hardened skeptics—he’ll get the people ready for God.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10668" class="text Luke-1-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Zachariah said to the angel, “Do you expect me to believe this? I’m an old man and my wife is an old woman.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10669" class="text Luke-1-19-Luke-1-20"><sup class="versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>But the angel said, “I am Gabriel, the sentinel of God, sent especially to bring you this glad news. But because you won’t believe me, you’ll be unable to say a word until the day of your son’s birth. Every word I’ve spoken to you will come true on time—<i>God’s</i> time.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10670" class="text Luke-1-21-Luke-1-22"><sup class="versenum">21-22&nbsp;</sup>Meanwhile, the congregation waiting for Zachariah was getting restless, wondering what was keeping him so long in the sanctuary. When he came out and couldn’t speak, they knew he had seen a vision. He continued speechless and had to use sign language with the people.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-10671" class="text Luke-1-23-Luke-1-25"><sup class="versenum">23-25&nbsp;</sup>When the course of his priestly assignment was completed, he went back home. It wasn’t long before his wife, Elizabeth, conceived. She went off by herself for five months, relishing her pregnancy. “So, this is how God acts to remedy my unfortunate condition!” she said.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-10672" class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28">A Virgin Conceives</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28"><sup class="versenum">26-28&nbsp;</sup>In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to the Galilean village of Nazareth to a virgin engaged to be married to a man descended from David. His name was Joseph, and the virgin’s name, Mary. Upon entering, Gabriel greeted her:</span></p><div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28">Good morning!</span><br><span class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28">You’re beautiful with God’s beauty,</span><br><span class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28">Beautiful inside and out!</span><br><span class="text Luke-1-26-Luke-1-28">God be with you.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-10673" class="text Luke-1-29-Luke-1-33"><sup class="versenum">29-33&nbsp;</sup>She was thoroughly shaken, wondering what was behind a greeting like that.
