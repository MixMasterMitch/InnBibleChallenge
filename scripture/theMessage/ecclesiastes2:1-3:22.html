I left all my predecessors in Jerusalem far behind, left them behind in the dust. What’s more, I kept a clear head through it all. Everything I wanted I took—I never said no to myself. I gave in to every impulse, held back nothing. I sucked the marrow of pleasure out of every task—my reward to myself for a hard day’s work!</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-7452" class="text Eccl-2-11">I Hate Life</span></h3><p class="first-line-none"><span class="text Eccl-2-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Then I took a good look at everything I’d done, looked at all the sweat and hard work. But when I looked, I saw nothing but smoke. Smoke and spitting into the wind. There was nothing to any of it. Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7453" class="text Eccl-2-12-Eccl-2-14"><sup class="versenum">12-14&nbsp;</sup>And then I took a hard look at what’s smart and what’s stupid. What’s left to do after you’ve been king? That’s a hard act to follow. You just do what you can, and that’s it. But I did see that it’s better to be smart than stupid, just as light is better than darkness. Even so, though the smart ones see where they’re going and the stupid ones grope in the dark, they’re all the same in the end. One fate for all—and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7454" class="text Eccl-2-15-Eccl-2-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>When I realized that my fate’s the same as the fool’s, I had to ask myself, “So why bother being wise?” It’s all smoke, nothing but smoke. The smart and the stupid both disappear out of sight. In a day or two they’re both forgotten. Yes, both the smart and the stupid die, and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7455" class="text Eccl-2-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>I hate life. As far as I can see, what happens on earth is a bad business. It’s smoke—and spitting into the wind.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7456" class="text Eccl-2-18-Eccl-2-19"><sup class="versenum">18-19&nbsp;</sup>And I hated everything I’d accomplished and accumulated on this earth. I can’t take it with me—no, I have to leave it to whoever comes after me. Whether they’re worthy or worthless—and who’s to tell?—they’ll take over the earthly results of my intense thinking and hard work. Smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7457" class="text Eccl-2-20-Eccl-2-23"><sup class="versenum">20-23&nbsp;</sup>That’s when I called it quits, gave up on anything that could be hoped for on this earth. What’s the point of working your fingers to the bone if you hand over what you worked for to someone who never lifted a finger for it? Smoke, that’s what it is. A bad business from start to finish. So what do you get from a life of hard labor? Pain and grief from dawn to dusk. Never a decent night’s rest. Nothing but smoke.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7458" class="text Eccl-2-24-Eccl-2-26"><sup class="versenum">24-26&nbsp;</sup>The best you can do with your life is have a good time and get by the best you can. The way I see it, that’s it—divine fate. Whether we feast or fast, it’s up to God. God may give wisdom and knowledge and joy to his favorites, but sinners are assigned a life of hard labor, and end up turning their wages over to God’s favorites. Nothing but smoke—and spitting into the wind.</span></p> <h3><span id="en-MSG-7459" class="text Eccl-3-1">There’s a Right Time for Everything</span></h3><p class="first-line-none chapter-1"><span class="text Eccl-3-1"><span class="chapternum">3&nbsp;</span>There’s an opportune time to do things, a right time for everything on the earth:</span></p> <div class="poetry top-1"><p class="line"><span id="en-MSG-7460" class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8"><sup class="versenum">2-8&nbsp;</sup>A right time for birth and another for death,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to plant and another to reap,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to kill and another to heal,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to destroy and another to construct,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to cry and another to laugh,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to lament and another to cheer,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to make love and another to abstain,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to embrace and another to part,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to search and another to count your losses,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to hold on and another to let go,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to rip out and another to mend,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to shut up and another to speak up,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to love and another to hate,</span><br><span class="text Eccl-3-2-Eccl-3-8">A right time to wage war and another to make peace.</span></p></div> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-7461" class="text Eccl-3-9-Eccl-3-13"><sup class="versenum">9-13&nbsp;</sup>But in the end, does it really make a difference what anyone does? I’ve had a good look at what God has given us to do—busywork, mostly. True, God made everything beautiful in itself and in its time—but he’s left us in the dark, so we can never know what God is up to, whether he’s coming or going. I’ve decided that there’s nothing better to do than go ahead and have a good time and get the most we can out of life. That’s it—eat, drink, and make the most of your job. It’s God’s gift.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7462" class="text Eccl-3-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>I’ve also concluded that whatever God does, that’s the way it’s going to be, always. No addition, no subtraction. God’s done it and that’s it.

The place of righteousness—corrupt! I said to myself, “God will judge righteous and wicked.” There’s a right time for every thing, every deed—and there’s no getting around it. I said to myself regarding the human race, “God’s testing the lot of us, showing us up as nothing but animals.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-7465" class="text Eccl-3-19-Eccl-3-22"><sup class="versenum">19-22&nbsp;</sup>Humans and animals come to the same end—humans die, animals die. We all breathe the same air. So there’s really no advantage in being human. None. Everything’s smoke. We all end up in the same place—we all came from dust, we all end up as dust. Nobody knows for sure that the human spirit rises to heaven or that the animal spirit sinks into the earth. So I made up my mind that there’s nothing better for us men and women than to have a good time in whatever we do—that’s our lot. Who knows if there’s anything else to life?</span></p>
