Then the king proceeded to The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, bringing everyone in his train—priests and prophets and people ranging from the famous to the unknown. Then he read out publicly everything written in the Book of the Covenant that was found in The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. The king stood by the pillar and before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> solemnly committed them all to the covenant: to follow <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> believingly and obediently; to follow his instructions, heart and soul, on what to believe and do; to put into practice the entire covenant, all that was written in the book. The people stood in affirmation; their commitment was unanimous.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4750" class="text 2Kgs-23-4-2Kgs-23-9"><sup class="versenum">4-9&nbsp;</sup>Then the king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, his associate priest, and The Temple sentries to clean house—to get rid of everything in The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> that had been made for worshiping Baal and Asherah and the cosmic powers. He had them burned outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and then disposed of the ashes in Bethel. He fired the pagan priests whom the kings of Judah had hired to supervise the local sex-and-religion shrines in the towns of Judah and neighborhoods of Jerusalem. In a stroke he swept the country clean of the polluting stench of the round-the-clock worship of Baal, sun and moon, stars—all the so-called cosmic powers. He took the obscene phallic Asherah pole from The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> to the Valley of Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned it up, then ground up the ashes and scattered them in the cemetery. He tore out the rooms of the male sacred prostitutes that had been set up in The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>; women also used these rooms for weavings for Asherah. He swept the outlying towns of Judah clean of priests and smashed the sex-and-religion shrines where they worked their trade from one end of the country to the other—all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He smashed the sex-and-religion shrine that had been set up just to the left of the city gate for the private use of Joshua, the city mayor. Even though these sex-and-religion priests did not defile the Altar in The Temple itself, they were part of the general priestly corruption and had to go.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4751" class="text 2Kgs-23-10-2Kgs-23-11"><sup class="versenum">10-11&nbsp;</sup>Then Josiah demolished the Topheth, the iron furnace griddle set up in the Valley of Ben Hinnom for sacrificing children in the fire. No longer could anyone burn son or daughter to the god Molech. He hauled off the horse statues honoring the sun god that the kings of Judah had set up near the entrance to The Temple. They were in the courtyard next to the office of Nathan-Melech, the warden. He burned up the sun-chariots as so much rubbish.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4752" class="text 2Kgs-23-12-2Kgs-23-15"><sup class="versenum">12-15&nbsp;</sup>The king smashed all the altars to smithereens—the altar on the roof shrine of Ahaz, the various altars the kings of Judah had made, the altars of Manasseh that littered the courtyard of The Temple—he smashed them all, pulverized the fragments, and scattered their dust in the Valley of Kidron. The king proceeded to make a clean sweep of all the sex-and-religion shrines that had proliferated east of Jerusalem on the south slope of Abomination Hill, the ones Solomon king of Israel had built to the obscene Sidonian sex goddess Ashtoreth, to Chemosh the dirty-old-god of the Moabites, and to Milcom the depraved god of the Ammonites. He tore apart the altars, chopped down the phallic Asherah-poles, and scattered old bones over the sites. Next, he took care of the altar at the shrine in Bethel that Jeroboam son of Nebat had built—the same Jeroboam who had led Israel into a life of sin. He tore apart the altar, burned down the shrine leaving it in ashes, and then lit fire to the phallic Asherah-pole.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4753" class="text 2Kgs-23-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>As Josiah looked over the scene, he noticed the tombs on the hillside. He ordered the bones removed from the tombs and had them cremated on the ruined altars, desacralizing the evil altars. This was a fulfillment of the word of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> spoken by the Holy Man years before when Jeroboam had stood by the altar at the sacred convocation.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4754" class="text 2Kgs-23-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Then the king said, “And <i>that</i> memorial stone—whose is that?”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-23-17">The men from the city said, “That’s the grave of the Holy Man who spoke the message against the altar at Bethel that you have just fulfilled.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4755" class="text 2Kgs-23-18"><sup class="versenum">18&nbsp;</sup>Josiah said, “Don’t trouble his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet from Samaria.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4756" class="text 2Kgs-23-19-2Kgs-23-20"><sup class="versenum">19-20&nbsp;</sup>But Josiah hadn’t finished. He now moved through all the towns of Samaria where the kings of Israel had built neighborhood sex-and-religion shrines, shrines that had so angered <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. He tore the shrines down and left them in ruins—just as at Bethel. He killed all the priests who had conducted the sacrifices and cremated them on their own altars, thus desacralizing the altars. Only then did Josiah return to Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4757" class="text 2Kgs-23-21"><sup class="versenum">21&nbsp;</sup>The king now commanded the people, “Celebrate the Passover to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, your God, exactly as directed in this Book of the Covenant.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4758" class="text 2Kgs-23-22-2Kgs-23-23"><sup class="versenum">22-23&nbsp;</sup>This commanded Passover had not been celebrated since the days that the judges judged Israel—none of the kings of Israel and Judah had celebrated it. But in the eighteenth year of the rule of King Josiah this very Passover was celebrated to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> in Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4759" class="text 2Kgs-23-24"><sup class="versenum">24&nbsp;</sup>Josiah scrubbed the place clean and trashed spirit-mediums, sorcerers, domestic gods, and carved figures—all the vast accumulation of foul and obscene relics and images on display everywhere you looked in Judah and Jerusalem. Josiah did this in obedience to the words of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s Revelation written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4760" class="text 2Kgs-23-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>There was no king to compare with Josiah—neither before nor after—a king who turned in total and repentant obedience to <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, heart and mind and strength, following the instructions revealed to and written by Moses. The world would never again see a king like Josiah.</span></p>
