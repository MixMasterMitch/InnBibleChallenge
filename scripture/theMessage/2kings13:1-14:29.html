He lived an evil life before <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, walking step for step in the tracks of Jeroboam son of Nebat who led Israel into a life of sin, swerving neither left or right. Exasperated, <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was furious with Israel and turned them over to Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad son of Hazael. This domination went on for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4594" class="text 2Kgs-13-4-2Kgs-13-6"><sup class="versenum">4-6&nbsp;</sup>Then Jehoahaz prayed for a softening of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s anger, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> listened. He realized how wretched Israel had become under the brutalities of the king of Aram. So <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> provided a savior for Israel who brought them out from under Aram’s oppression. The children of Israel were again able to live at peace in their own homes. But it didn’t make any difference: They didn’t change their lives, didn’t turn away from the Jeroboam-sins that now characterized Israel, including the sex-and-religion shrines of Asherah still flourishing in Samaria.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4595" class="text 2Kgs-13-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Nothing was left of Jehoahaz’s army after Hazael’s oppression except for fifty cavalry, ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry. The king of Aram had decimated the rest, leaving behind him mostly chaff.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4596" class="text 2Kgs-13-8-2Kgs-13-9"><sup class="versenum">8-9&nbsp;</sup>The rest of the life and times of Jehoahaz, the record of his accomplishments, are written in <i>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</i>.

In <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s eyes he lived an evil life. He didn’t deviate one bit from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into a life of sin. He plodded along in the same tracks, step after step.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4598" class="text 2Kgs-13-12-2Kgs-13-13"><sup class="versenum">12-13&nbsp;</sup>The rest of the life and times of Jehoash, the record of his accomplishments and his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are written in <i>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</i>. Jehoash died and joined his ancestors. Jeroboam took over his throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria in the royal cemetery.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4599" class="text 2Kgs-13-14"><sup class="versenum">14&nbsp;</sup>Elisha came down sick. It was the sickness of which he would soon die. Jehoash king of Israel paid him a visit. When he saw him he wept openly, crying, “My father, my father! Chariot and horsemen of Israel!”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4600" class="text 2Kgs-13-15"><sup class="versenum">15&nbsp;</sup>Elisha told him, “Go and get a bow and some arrows.” The king brought him the bow and arrows.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4601" class="text 2Kgs-13-16"><sup class="versenum">16&nbsp;</sup>Then he told the king, “Put your hand on the bow.” He put his hand on the bow. Then Elisha put his hand over the hand of the king.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4602" class="text 2Kgs-13-17"><sup class="versenum">17&nbsp;</sup>Elisha said, “Now open the east window.” He opened it.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-17">Then he said, “Shoot!” And he shot.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-17">“The arrow of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>’s salvation!” exclaimed Elisha. “The arrow of deliverance from Aram!

He picked them up.</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-18">Then he said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground.”</span></p><p><span class="text 2Kgs-13-18">The king struck the ground three times and then quit.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4604" class="text 2Kgs-13-19"><sup class="versenum">19&nbsp;</sup>The Holy Man became angry with him: “Why didn’t you hit the ground five or six times? Then you would beat Aram until he was finished. As it is, you’ll defeat him three times only.”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4605" class="text 2Kgs-13-20-2Kgs-13-21"><sup class="versenum">20-21&nbsp;</sup>Then Elisha died and they buried him.</span></p><p class="top-1"><span class="text 2Kgs-13-20-2Kgs-13-21">Some time later, raiding bands of Moabites, as they often did, invaded the country. One day, some men were burying a man and spotted the raiders. They threw the man into Elisha’s tomb and got away. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came alive, stood up, and walked out on his own two feet.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4606" class="text 2Kgs-13-22-2Kgs-13-24"><sup class="versenum">22-24&nbsp;</sup>Hazael king of Aram badgered and bedeviled Israel all through the reign of Jehoahaz. But <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was gracious and showed mercy to them. He stuck with them out of respect for his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He never gave up on them, never even considered discarding them, even to this day. Hazael king of Aram died. His son Ben-Hadad was the next king.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4607" class="text 2Kgs-13-25"><sup class="versenum">25&nbsp;</sup>Jehoash son of Jehoahaz turned things around and took back the cities that Ben-Hadad son of Hazael had taken from his father Jehoahaz.

He was twenty-five years old when he became king and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin. She was from Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4609" class="text 2Kgs-14-3-2Kgs-14-4"><sup class="versenum">3-4&nbsp;</sup>He lived the way <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> wanted and did the right thing. But he didn’t come up to the standards of his ancestor David; instead he lived pretty much as his father Joash had; the local sex-and-religion shrines continued to stay in business with people frequenting them.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4610" class="text 2Kgs-14-5-2Kgs-14-6"><sup class="versenum">5-6&nbsp;</sup>When he had the affairs of the kingdom well in hand, he executed the palace guard that had assassinated his father the king. But he didn’t kill the sons of the assassins. He was obedient to what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> commanded, written in the Word revealed to Moses, that parents shouldn’t be executed for their children’s sins, nor children for those of their parents. We each pay personally for our sins.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4611" class="text 2Kgs-14-7"><sup class="versenum">7&nbsp;</sup>Amaziah roundly defeated Edom in the Valley of Salt to the tune of ten thousand dead.

Just because you’ve defeated Edom in battle, you now think you’re a big shot. Go ahead and be proud, but stay home. Why press your luck? Why bring defeat on yourself and Judah?”</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4614" class="text 2Kgs-14-11"><sup class="versenum">11&nbsp;</sup>Amaziah wouldn’t take No for an answer. So Jehoash king of Israel gave in and agreed to a battle between him and Amaziah king of Judah. They met at Beth Shemesh, a town of Judah.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4615" class="text 2Kgs-14-12"><sup class="versenum">12&nbsp;</sup>Judah was thoroughly beaten by Israel—all their soldiers ran home in defeat.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4616" class="text 2Kgs-14-13-2Kgs-14-14"><sup class="versenum">13-14&nbsp;</sup>Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. But Jehoash didn’t stop there; he went on to attack Jerusalem. He demolished the wall of Jerusalem all the way from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a stretch of about six hundred feet. He looted the gold, silver, and furnishings—anything he found that was worth taking—from both the palace and The Temple of <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>. And, for good measure, he took hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.</span></p> <p><span id="en-MSG-4617" class="text 2Kgs-14-15-2Kgs-14-16"><sup class="versenum">15-16&nbsp;</sup>The rest of the life and times of Jehoash, his significant accomplishments and the fight with Amaziah king of Judah, are all written in <i>The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</i>.

As far as <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was concerned he lived an evil life, never deviating an inch from all the sin of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who led Israel into a life of sin. But he did restore the borders of Israel to Lebo Hamath in the far north and to the Dead Sea in the south, matching what <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span>, the God of Israel, had pronounced through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.</span></p> <p class="top-1"><span id="en-MSG-4622" class="text 2Kgs-14-26-2Kgs-14-27"><sup class="versenum">26-27&nbsp;</sup><span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="small-caps">God</span> was fully aware of the trouble in Israel, its bitterly hard times.
